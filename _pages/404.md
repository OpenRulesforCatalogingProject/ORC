## DCRMR is currently under construction

The DCRMR text is actively being developed and this website is currently under construction.  Quite possibly, you have reached this page because what you are looking for hasn't been released into the wilds of the bibliographic universe yet.

If you have reached this page and you know the intended content indeed does exist, please consider reporting the broken/bad link by adding a comment to this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/rbms-bsc/DCRMR/issues/26) or email the [DCRMR editor](mailto:dcrm.rda@gmail.com) directly.

Thank you for helping make the DCRMR development a success by reporting bad and broken links.  It is greatly appreciated.

Kind regards,

The RBMS RDA Editorial Group
