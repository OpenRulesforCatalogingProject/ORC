## II.1 RDA, LC-PCC PS, and other cataloging documentation

<a name="II.1.1">II.1.1</a> DCRMR is a revision of the *Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials* suite (DCRM) based on RDA and the Library of Congress/Program for Cooperative Cataloging Policy Statements (LC-PCC PS). DCRMR deviates in substance from RDA and LC-PCC PS  only when required by the particular descriptive needs of rare materials. In matters of style, presentation, wording, and arrangement, DCRMR follows its own conventions. 

DCRMR builds upon RDA data elements and guidelines. Refer to RDA for guidance and instuctions on matters of description not covered in DCRMR. The relevant sections of RDA must be consulted for rules governing name and title access points. DCRMR is independent of the LC-PCC Policy Statements and does not assume application of LC-PCC PS. 

For subject headings, numerous controlled vocabularies are available; within the United States, the Library of Congress Subject Headings are widely used. Consult classification documentation for assignment of call numbers. For genre/form headings and other terms of relevance to special collections cataloging, consult the [Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms](https://id.loc.gov/authorities/genreForms.html){:target="_blank"}, the [RBMS Controlled Vocabularies](http://rbms.info/vocabularies/index.shtml){:target="_blank"}, and other controlled vocabularies as needed (e.g., [Art & Architecture Thesaurus Online](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/){:target="_blank"}.

## II.2 Metadata Encoding Standards

<a name="II.2.1">II.2.1</a> At the time of publication, *MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data* is still the most commonly used metadata encoding standard for bibliographic cataloging. Use of DCRMR, however, is not restricted to MARC 21 and may be used with other metadata encoding standards or with production of printed or card catalogs. Use of MARC 21 coding appears only in some of the appendixes. Catalogers should follow encoding standard documentation for input and be aware of how their local systems generate display.
