## I.1 Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials

<a name="I.1.1">I.1.1</a> The Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials manuals provide specialized cataloging instructions for various formats of rare materials typically found in rare book, manuscript, and special collection repositories. The term “rare materials” is used to refer to any special materials that repositories have chosen to distinguish from general materials by the ways in which they house, preserve, or collect them. Rarity in the narrow sense of “scarcity” may or may not be a feature of these materials. The original DCRM suite was written to accompany AACR2 and includes six format-specific manuals: books, serials, graphics, music, cartographic, and manuscripts. 

## I.2 Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials (RDA Edition)

<a name="I.2">I.2.1</a> When completed, DCRMR will provide guidelines and instructions for descriptive cataloging of rare materials in all formats. The initial release includes only instructions for descriptive cataloging of rare books, that is, printed textual monographs receiving special treatment within a repository. Instructions for additional formats will be added as the RBMS RDA Editorial Group completes writing guidelines.
DCRMR may be used for resources of any age or type of production. DCRMR is informed by long-standing Anglo-American practice in describing rare materials, as embodied in the DCRM suite of manuals. When creating RDA descriptions, use DCRMR. The [DCRM manuals](http://rbms.info/dcrm/) are still appropriate for descriptions based on AACR2.

## I.3 Need for special rules

<a name="I.3.1">I.3.1</a> Resources in special collections often present situations not ordinarily encountered in the cataloging of typical modern publications (e.g., variation between copies, cancelled leaves, etc.) and may require additional details of description in order to identify significant characteristics (e.g., bibliographical format, typeface, etc.). Such details are important for two reasons. They permit the ready identification of copies of a resource (e.g., as editions, impressions, or issues), and they provide a more exact description of the resource as an artifact.

## I.4 Scope of application

<a name="I.4.1">I.4.1</a> DCRMR is especially appropriate for the description of printed resources produced before the introduction of machine printing in the nineteenth century, for item-level description of manuscripts, and for description of graphic materials collected for the purpose of detailed study. However, it may be used to describe any resource, including machine-press publications, artists’ books, private press books, and other contemporary manifestations. 
Rare materials are those for which an agency chooses to provide a more detailed description. The treatment may be applied for any reason, including, but not limited to, age, rarity, fragility, enduring value, or importance as part of a collection. These rules may be applied categorically based on date or place of publication (e.g., all British and North American imprints published before 1831), or may be applied selectively, according to the administrative policy of the institution, which may choose to catalog some or all of its holdings at a more detailed level of description than that provided for in RDA. 

## I.5 Application within the metadata description

<a name="I.5.1">I.5.1</a> DCRMR contains instructions for describing the resource, chiefly at the manifestation and item level, with instructions at the work or expression level as needed. It does not address the construction and assignment of access points, although brief instructions relating to access points do appear throughout.
