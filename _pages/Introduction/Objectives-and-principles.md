<a name="III">III</a> The instructions contained in DCRMR are formulated according to the objectives and principles set forth below. These objectives and principles seek to articulate the purpose and nature of specialized cataloging rules for rare materials. They are informed by long-accepted concepts in bibliographic scholarship and cataloging, as well as by more recent theoretical works, namely the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions’ *Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records* (FRBR) and *Library Reference Model* (LRM), and Elaine Svenonius’s *The Intellectual Foundation of Information Organization*. As such, the objectives and principles are also in conformity with the IFLA *Statement of International Cataloguing Principles*. They assume familiarity with the LRM entities (work, expression, manifestation, item, etc.) as well as bibliographic terms used to differentiate among textual variants (edition, issue, impression, and state). It is hoped that these objectives and principles will provide catalogers, and administrators of cataloging operations, with a better understanding of the underlying rationale for DCRMR instructions.

## III.1 Functional objectives of DCRMR

<a name="III.1">III.1</a> The primary objectives in cataloging special collections resources are no different from those in cataloging other resources. These objectives focus on meeting user needs to find, identify, select, obtain, and explore. However, users of special collections resources often bring specialized requirements to these tasks that cannot be fully met by general cataloging guidelines, such as those contained in RDA. In addition, the standard production practices assumed in general cataloging rules do not always apply to special collections resources. The following DCRMR objectives are designed to accommodate these important differences.

### III.1.1 Users must be able to investigate physical processes and post-production history and context exemplified in resources described

<a name="III.1.1.1">III.1.1.1</a> Users of special collections resources routinely investigate a variety of artifactual and post-production aspects of materials. For example, they may want to locate resources that are related by printing methods, illustration processes, binding styles and structures, provenance, genre/form, etc. The ability of users to identify resources that fit these criteria depends upon full and accurate descriptions and the recording of appropriate access points and relationships.

### III.1.2 Users must be able to distinguish clearly among different manifestations of an expression of a work

<a name="III.1.2.1">III.1.2.1</a> The ability to distinguish among different manifestations of an expression of a work is critical to the user tasks of identifying and selecting resources. Users of rare materials require full and faithful transcriptions, detailed physical descriptions, and careful recording of various distinguishing points in order to identify separate manifestations. 

Additionally, users of special collections resources are typically interested in drawing finer distinctions among variants within manifestations than are users of other resources, including not simply between editions and issues but between variant impressions and states; many also need to distinguish between copies at the item level.

### III.1.3 Users must be able to perform most identification and selection tasks without direct access to the resources

<a name="III.1.3.1">III.1.3.1</a> Users of special collections resources frequently perform identification and selection tasks under circumstances that require the description to stand as a detailed surrogate for the item (e.g., consultation from a distance, limited access due to the fragile condition of the item, inability to physically browse collections housed in restricted areas, etc.). Accuracy of descriptive representation increases subsequent efficiency for both users and collection managers. The same accuracy contributes to the long-term preservation of the materials themselves, by reducing unnecessary circulation and examination of materials that do not precisely meet users’ requirements.

### III.1.4 Users must be able to gain access to resources whose production or presentation characteristics differ from modern conventions

<a name="III.1.4.1">III.1.4.1</a> In special collections resources, explicit evidence concerning details of publication and manufacture will often be lacking or insufficient to distinguish among different manifestations. That which is bibliographically significant may thus be obscured. In order to distinguish among manifestations, the instructions in DCRMR provide guidance for recording bibliographic evidence presented in forms that differ from modern conventions (e.g. signature statements).

## III.2 Principles of DCRMR construction 

<a name="III.2">III.2</a> To meet the objectives listed above, DCRMR relies upon the following six principles. These principles are influenced by the general principles of bibliographic description offered by Svenonius: user convenience; representation; sufficiency and necessity; standardization; and integration.

### III.2.1 Rules provide guidance for descriptions that allow users to distinguish clearly among different manifestations of an expression of a work

<a name="III.2.1.1">III.2.1.1</a> This principle derives from the general principle of user convenience and has implications for all elements of the bibliographic description. The principle relates to objective 2 stated above. 

### III.2.2 Rules provide for accurate representations of the resource as it describes itself, notably through instructions regarding transcription, transposition, and omission

<a name="III.2.2.1">III.2.2.1</a> This principle derives from the general principles of representation (with its related subprinciple of accuracy) and of standardization. Precise representation is of particular relevance in those elements that require transcription (title and statement of responsibility, edition, publication, distribution, manufacture, and series), but should not be ignored in physical description and notes. The general principles of representation and standardization stand in greater tension with each other when cataloging rare materials. Faithfulness to both principles may require descriptive and annotative treatment necessarily exceeding the norms (and at times the vocabulary) established as sufficient for the description of general materials. The principle relates to objectives 3 and 4 stated above. 

### III.2.3 Rules provide guidance for the inclusion of manifestation-specific and item-specific information that permits users to investigate physical processes and post-production history and context exemplified in the item described

<a name="III.2.3.1">III.2.3.1</a> This principle derives from the general principle of sufficiency and necessity (with its related subprinciple of significance). Application of the principle requires that rules for rare materials cataloging provide additional guidance on access points, particularly in cases where such information is not integral to the manifestation, expression, or work described. Instructions for item-specific information appearing in notes may recommend standard forms for presentation of information (addressing the general principle of user convenience and its related subprinciple of common usage). Application of such instructions presumes both a user’s need for such information and a cataloger’s ability to properly describe such aspects. The principle relates to objective 1 stated above. 

### III.2.4 Rules provide for the inclusion of all elements of bibliographical significance

<a name="III.2.4.1">III.2.4.1</a> General cataloging codes like RDA routinely strive for both brevity and clarity, principles affiliated with the general principle of sufficiency. In describing rare materials, too great an emphasis on brevity may become the occasion for insufficiency and lack of clarity. Brevity of description may be measured best against the functional requirements of the particular bibliographic description rather than against the average physical length of other bibliographic descriptions in the catalog. A natural tension exists between the requirements of accurate representation of an item and the requirements of sufficiency. Reference to the principle of user convenience may offer correct resolution of such tension. This principle is related to all of the objectives stated above. 

### III.2.5 Rules conform to the RDA Toolkit to the extent possible

<a name="III.2.5.1">III.2.5.1</a> This principle relates to general principles of standardization and user convenience (with the latter’s subprinciple of common usage). DCRMR assumes that users of bibliographic descriptions constructed in accordance with its provisions operate in contexts where RDA and LC-PCC PS are the accepted standards for the cataloging of general materials. DCRMR does not introduce instructions that are not required by differences expected between special collections and general collections resources. 

Although the latest version of the RDA Toolkit is still in beta at the time of this writing, the RDA Steering Committee (RSC) has scheduled the beta version to become the authorized version on December 15, 2020. Therefore, DCRMR uses existing RDA vocabulary in a manner consistent with the RDA Beta Toolkit; any additional specialized vocabulary necessary for description and access of rare materials occurs in a clear and consistent manner in DCRMR instructions, appendices, and glossary entries. 

The structure and numbering of DCRMR are new. Since the Beta Toolkit does not present elements in any given order, DCRMR introduces order based generally on ISBD, but grouping notes with the element they describe (e.g., Note on title has been added to the Title chapter) and adding chapters for statement of responsibility item-specific notes.

### III.2.6 Rules are compatible with the DCRM suite except in cases where changes are necessary to align more closely to the RDA Beta Toolkit or to conform to the above principles

<a name="III.2.6.1">III.2.6.1</a> This principle relates to general principles of standardization and user convenience (with the latter’s subprinciple of common usage). Records created according to instructions in DCRM/AACR2 and DCRMR/RDA will co-exist in catalogs. Therefore, changes to DCRM cataloging practices were introduced only after careful consideration of the value or necessity of such changes. Although DCRMR instructions are compatible with the RDA Beta Toolkit, the text is an update to the instructions in the DCRM manuals rather than directly modeled on RDA. This is a departure from past practice; in DCRM, when an existing AACR2 rule satisfied the requirements of cataloging rare materials, DCRM text was modeled on AACR2 text, using carefully considered alternative wording only in cases where the language of AACR2 was not precise enough.
