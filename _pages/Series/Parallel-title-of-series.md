<a name="8.215.1.1">8.215.1.1</a> [Link to RDA Toolkit](https://beta.rdatoolkit.org/Content/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-9a2bd933-3204-3798-840a-dc55a5a237d0){:target="_blank"}

<a name="8.215.1.2">8.215.1.2</a> [Source of information](/DCRMR/series/)

## 8.215.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="8.215.2.1">8.215.2.1</a> A nomen that is a title of series in another language or script.

## 8.215.3 General rule

<a name="8.215.3.1">8.215.3.1</a> If the source bears a series title in more than one language or script, transcribe as the series title the title that is in the language or script of the [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/). If this criterion does not apply, transcribe the title that appears first in the source. Transcribe the remaining title(s), together with any associated information, as parallel title of series. Make a [Note on series statement](/DCRMR/series/Note-on-series-statement/) to indicate the original position on the source of any transposed titles (see [8.29.31.1](/DCRMR/series/Note-on-series-statement/#8.29.31.1)).

>Example:    
>Parallel title of series: <CITE>Villes du Canada, vues à vol d'oiseau</CITE>    
>Title proper of series: <CITE>Canadian cities, bird's eye views</CITE>  

>Example:    
>Parallel title of series: <CITE>European university papers</CITE>    
>Parallel title of series: <CITE>Publications universitaires européennes</CITE>   
>Title proper of series: <CITE>Europäische Hochschulschriften</CITE>  

<a name="8.215.3.2">8.215.3.2</a> *Optionally*, if it is considered that the parallel titles of series are too numerous to list exhaustively, and that some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, omit parallel series titles after the first using the mark of omission.

## 8.215.31 Parallel subseries titles

<a name="8.215.31.1">8.215.31.1</a> If there are both parallel series titles and subseries titles on the resource, transcribe each subseries after the series title to which it relates. If any parallel titles have been omitted from the transcription, also omit their associated subseries.
