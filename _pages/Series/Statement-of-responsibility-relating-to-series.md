## 6.25.3 General rule

<a name="6.25.3.1">6.25.3.1</a> Transcribe a statement of responsibility relating to the series, if present. If the statement of responsibility does not appear after the series title in the source, transpose as needed. Provide details of the transposition in a [Note on series statement](/DCRMR/series/Note-on-series-statement/) (see [6.28.3.1](/DCRMR/series/Note-on-series-statement/#6.28.3.1)). However, if the statement of responsibility is grammatically inseparable from the series title, transcribe it as part of [Title of series](/DCRMR/series/Title-of-series/) (see [6.21.3.3](/DCRMR/series/Title-of-series/#6.21.3.3)).
