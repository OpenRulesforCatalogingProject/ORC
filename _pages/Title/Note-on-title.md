Do the same for single-volume manifestations that contain multiple parts. If it is not feasible to do this, transcribe the title proper of the first volume or part without this interpolation and make a note about the later designation(s) (see [Title proper, 1.21.33.1](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/#1.21.33.1)).

<a name="1.29.35.2">1.29.35.2</a> When a word or phrase obviously intended as title but not appearing in the first line of printing is selected as the title, make a note recording at least the first five words of the first line of printing (see [Title proper, 1.21.382.1](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/#1.21.382.1)).

<a name="1.29.35.3">1.29.35.3</a> Make a note summarizing material omitted from a title transcribed from the initial text on a single-sheet manifestation if considered important (see [Title proper, 1.21.382.2](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/#1.21.382.2)).

<a name="1.29.36.3">1.29.36.3</a> Make an explanatory note about cataloger-supplied letters or words (e.g., when special marks of contraction have been used by the printer in continuance of the manuscript tradition) if considered important (see [Transcription, 0.4.16](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0416-brevigraphs)).
