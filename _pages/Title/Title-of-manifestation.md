## 1.2.32 Title access points

<a name="1.2.32.1">1.2.32.1</a> Title access plays an important role in enabling users to identify and locate special collections materials. Titles may apply to a resource at the work, expression, manifestation, or item level. While some title access will be handled by controlled forms, these instructions cover specific situations commonly encountered by rare materials catalogers, in which the provision of uncontrolled title access points is likely to be useful. 
 
<a name="1.2.32.2">1.2.32.2</a> Use judgment in determining which forms of title access will be most useful for the resource in hand. In general, do not include access points that duplicate normalized forms of existing title access points (e.g., the title proper, the preferred title, etc.). Take the indexing capabilities of the institution’s local system into consideration when determining whether the additional access points are needed.
