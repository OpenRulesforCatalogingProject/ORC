<a name="1.27.2.1">1.27.2.1</a> A nomen that is an appellation of item in natural language and phrasing used in common discourse.

## 1.27.3 General rule

<a name="1.27.3.1">1.27.3.1</a> Record titles of an item if considered important.  

## 1.27.31 Access points for item-specific titles

<a name="1.27.31.1">1.27.31.1</a> *Optionally*, provide access for item-specific titles, such as a binder’s title. Identify the item using a designation of the holding institution (e.g., a name, acronym, or code). Provide identification such as a designation of the item's physical location (e.g., a shelfmark) or an indication of the item's copy number (if the institution holds more than one exemplar of the manifestation) if considered important (see [9.4.3.4](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-item/#9.4.3.4)).

<a name="1.27.31.2">1.27.31.2</a> Use judgment in determining which forms of access will be most useful for the item in hand. In general, do not include access points that duplicate normalized forms of existing title access points (e.g., the title proper, the preferred title, etc.). Take the indexing capabilities of the institution’s local system into consideration when determining whether the additional access points are needed.
