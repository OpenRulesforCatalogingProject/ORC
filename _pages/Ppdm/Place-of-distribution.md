## 4.211.2 Definition and scope

<a name="4.211.2.1">4.211.2.1</a> A place associated with the distribution of a published manifestation.

## 4.211.3 General rule

<a name="4.211.3.1">4.211.3.1</a> Transcribe the names of places associated with the distribution of a published manifestation as part of this element. X.X. Transcribe the place of distribution as it appears on the manifestation. If the place appears together with the name of a larger jurisdiction (e.g., country, state, or similar designation), or multiple such jurisdictions, transcribe these as well.

Example: `Elizabeth-Town`

Example: `Köln`

Example: `Apud inclytam Germaniae Basileam`

Example: `Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Boston`

Example: `Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada`

## 4.211.4 Places of distribution with initial prepositions, etc.

<a name="4.211.4.1">4.211.4.1</a>  Include in the transcription any prepositions appearing before the place of distribution as well as any accompanying words or phrases associated with the place name.

Example: `A Lyon`

Example: `In London`

Example: `In Boston, printed`
(*Comment:* Title page reads: “In Boston, printed. 1705.” Following provisions of 4D3, “printed” is here transcribed with the place)

Example: `Printed at Bennington`

Example: `Impressum fuit hoc opus Venetiis`

## 4.211.5 Supplied modern forms of place names

<a name="4.211.5.1">4.211.5.1</a>  If considered necessary for identification and if known, supply in square brackets the modern form of the name of the place. Use an English form of the name, if there is one.

Example: `Christiania [Oslo]`

Example: `Eboracum [York]`

Example: `Monachii [Munich]`

## 4.211.6 Supplied fuller forms of place names 

<a name="4.211.6.1">4.211.6.1</a>  If a place name is found only in an abbreviated form on the manifestation, transcribe it as found. Supply in square brackets the full form of the name, or the remainder of the name, if considered necessary for identification.

Example: `Mpls [i.e. Minneapolis]`

Example: `Rio [de Janeiro]`

## 4.211.7 Supplied larger jurisdictions

<a name="4.211.7.1">4.211.7.1</a>  Supply in square brackets the name of the country, state, province, etc., after the name of the place if it is considered necessary for identification, or if it is considered necessary to distinguish the place from others of the same name. Use a modern English form of the name, if there is one. Use the abbreviations listed in [RDA Toolkit > Resources > Abbreviations and symbols](https://beta.rdatoolkit.org/en-US_ala-aacfb802-7f30-3bcd-8311-3f8b52c0c42c). 

Example: `Cambridge [England]`

Example: `Newport [R.I.]`

Example: `Washington [Pa.]`

## 4.211.8 Two or more places of distribution

<a name="4.211.8.1">4.211.8.1</a> If the manifestation shows two or more places of distribution, and all are related to the same distributor, transcribe all in the order in which they appear.

Example: `London ; York`

Example: `A Lausanne & se trouve à Paris`

<a name="4.211.8.2">4.211.8.2</a> *Optionally,* if it is considered that the places are too numerous to list exhaustively, and that some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, the place of distribution statement may be shortened by omitting all the places after the third. In such cases, use the mark of omission and supply after it in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission. Include the number of omitted places (if more than one) in the supplied phrase.

Example: `London ; Reading ; Bath ... [and 6 other cities in England]`

<a name="4.211.8.3">4.211.8.3</a> If a subsequent place of distribution is not related to the same distributor, transcribe it in association with the distributor to which it corresponds.

Example: `New York : Ivison, Phinney, and Co. ; London : Trübner & Co.`

<a name="4.211.8.4">4.211.8.4</a> Do not, however, transcribe a subsequent place as a place of distribution if it must be recorded as a grammatically inseparable part of another element.

Example: `Printed at Worcester, Massachusetts : By Isaiah Thomas : Sold by him in Worcester, by said Thomas and Andrews in Boston, and by said Thomas and Carlisle, in Walpole, Newhampshire`

<a name="4.211.8.5">4.211.8.5</a> If a place of distribution associated with an earlier manifestation appears together with the actual place of distribution of the manifestation being described, transcribe the places as a single element in the order in which they appear.

Example: `Philadelphia printed, London reprinted`

<a name="4.211.8.6">4.211.8.6</a> If both the place and distributor associated with an earlier manifestation appear together with the place and distributor of the manifestation being described, transcribe each place with the distributor to which it corresponds.

Example: `London : Printed for Knight and Lacy, Paternoster-Row ; Greenfield, Mass. : Re-printed by Ansel Phelps, and for sale by him at his bookstore, also by West & Richardson, Cummings, Hilliard & Co., Boston, and Wilder & Campbell, New-York`
