<a name="4.211.5.1">4.211.5.1</a> If considered necessary for identification and if known, supply in square brackets the modern form of the name of the place. Use an English form of the name, if there is one.

Use the abbreviations listed in [RDA Toolkit: Resources: Abbreviations and symbols](https://beta.rdatoolkit.org/en-US_ala-aacfb802-7f30-3bcd-8311-3f8b52c0c42c){:target="_blank"}.

## 4.211.8 Two or more places of distribution

<a name="4.211.8.1">4.211.8.1</a> If the manifestation shows two or more places of distribution, and all are related to the same distributor, transcribe all in the order in which they appear.

>Example:  
><CITE>London ; York</CITE>

>Example:  
><CITE>A Lausanne & se trouve à Paris</CITE>

<a name="4.211.8.2">4.211.8.2</a> *Optionally*, if it is considered that the places are too numerous to list exhaustively, and that some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, the place of distribution may be shortened by omitting all the places after the third. In such cases, use the mark of omission and supply after it in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission. Include the number of omitted places (if more than one) in the supplied phrase.

>Example:  
><CITE>London ; Reading ; Bath ... [and 6 other cities in England]</CITE>

<a name="4.211.8.3">4.211.8.3</a> If a subsequent place of distribution is not related to the same distributor, transcribe it in association with the distributor to which it corresponds.

>Example:  
><CITE>New York : Ivison, Phinney, and Co. ; London : Trübner & Co.</CITE>

<a name="4.211.8.4">4.211.8.4</a> Do not, however, transcribe a subsequent place as a place of distribution if it must be recorded as a grammatically inseparable part of another element.

>Example:  
><CITE>Printed at Worcester, Massachusetts : By Isaiah Thomas : Sold by him in Worcester, by said Thomas and Andrews in Boston, and by said Thomas and Carlisle, in Walpole, Newhampshire</CITE>

<a name="4.211.8.5">4.211.8.5</a> If a place of distribution associated with an earlier manifestation appears together with the actual place of distribution of the manifestation being described, transcribe the places as a single element in the order in which they appear.

>Example:  
><CITE>Philadelphia printed, London reprinted</CITE>

<a name="4.211.8.6">4.211.8.6</a> If both the place and [Name of distributor](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-distributor/) associated with an earlier manifestation appear together with the place and [Name of distributor](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-distributor/) of the manifestation being described, transcribe each place with the distributor to which it corresponds.

>Example:  
><CITE>London : Printed for Knight and Lacy, Paternoster-Row ; Greenfield, Mass. : Re-printed by Ansel Phelps, and for sale by him at his bookstore, also by West & Richardson, Cummings, Hilliard & Co., Boston, and Wilder & Campbell, New-York</CITE>

## 4.211.9 Places of distribution in multipart monographs

<a name="4.211.9.1">4.211.9.1</a> If the manifestation is issued in more than one physical part, and the place of distribution changes in the course of publication, give the place of distribution of the later part(s) in a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) (see [4.216.4.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#4.216.4.1)).

>Example:

## 4.211.95 Place names that are grammatically inseparable parts of other elements 

<a name="4.211.95.1">4.211.95.1</a> If the place of distribution appears only as a grammatically inseparable part of another element and is transcribed there, supply the place of distribution in square brackets (see [4.21.7.3](/DCRMR/ppdm/Distribution-statement/#4.21.7.3)). Use a modern English form of the name, if there is one.

>Example:  
><CITE>[Munich] : Durch Peter Clement, Kunstführer zu München</CITE>

## 4.211.96 Fictitious or incorrect places of distribution

<a name="4.211.96.1">4.211.96.1</a> If the place of distribution appearing on the manifestation is known to be fictitious or incorrect, transcribe it nonetheless and make an explanatory [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/). If the actual place is known, or can be reasonably surmised, supply a correction in square brackets. Use a modern English form of name, if there is one, and give the basis for the correction in a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) (see [4.216.4.2](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#4.216.4.2)).

<a name="4.211.96.3">4.211.96.3</a> *Optionally*, if considered necessary for identification, supply in square brackets the modern form of the name of the place. Use the form of the name in the language preferred by the agency creating the data.

## 4.211.97 No place of distribution

<a name="4.211.97.2">4.211.97.2</a> If the name of the place of distribution has changed over time, supply the name appropriate to the date of distribution if known (e.g., Leningrad, not Saint Petersburg, for manifestations published in that city between 1924 and 1991).

(Transcribe the address or sign as the [Name of distributor](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-distributor/) element; see [4.213.5.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-distributor/#4.213.5.1).) When supplying the place, give a justification in a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) if necessary (see [4.216.4.5](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#4.216.4.5)).

## 4.211.99 Place of distribution uncertain or unknown

<a name="4.211.99.1">4.211.99.1</a> If the place of distribution is uncertain, supply the name of the probable place of distribution with a question mark, using a modern English form of the name, if there is one, all in square brackets.
