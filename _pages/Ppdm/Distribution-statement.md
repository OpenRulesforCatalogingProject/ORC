## 5.25.1 Element information

<a name="5.25.1.1">5.25.1.1</a> [Link to RDA Toolkit](https://beta.rdatoolkit.org/Content/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-2112f6fd-1796-3e26-b0ae-d0eb776977e2){:target="_blank"}

<a name="5.26.1.2">5.26.1.2</a> [Sources of information](/DCRMR/ppdm/#5011-sources-of-information)

## 5.25.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="5.25.2.1">5.25.2.1</a> A statement that identifies a place of distribution, a distributor, or a date of distribution of a published manifestation.

## 5.25.3 General rule

<a name="5.25.3.1">5.25.3.1</a>  Transcribe the distribution statement in the form and order in which it is presented in the source, unless instructed otherwise by specific rules.

## 5.25.31 Information covered by labels, etc.

<a name="5.25.31.1">5.25.31.1</a> If any of the original details relating to the distribution statement are covered by a label, stamp, overprint, or other means showing later information, transcribe the later information. If the original details are visible or otherwise available, transcribe or give them in a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement) (see [5.285.31.4](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.31.4)).

<a name="5.25.31.2">5.25.31.2</a>  For printed materials with manuscript overwrite, use judgment in determining whether or not the overwrite should be transcribed as the distribution statement or as item-specific information. In case of doubt, consider the manuscript overwrite to be item-specific information and record as a [Note on item](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-item/) (see [9.4.3.1](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-item/#9.4.3.1)).

## 5.25.32 Elements relating to publication vs. elements relating to distribution or manufacture

<a name="5.25.32.1">5.25.32.1</a> Statements relating to distribution or manufacture will sometimes be more appropriately transcribed as elements of publication, and sometimes as elements of distribution or manufacture. The roles of publishers, printers and booksellers were not clearly delimited in the hand-press period. Statements relating to distribution or manufacture frequently appear prominently on early printed materials, reflecting the tendency of booksellers or printers to function as more than solely distributors or manufacturers. As the book trade industry became increasingly specialized over time, however, the role of the publisher gradually emerged as dominant, while manufacturer and distributor gradually diminished in importance.

## 5.25.33 Statements relating to distribution only

<a name="5.25.33.1">5.25.33.1</a> If the resource bears only a statement relating to distribution or multiple such statements, generally assume the distributor to also be functioning as publisher. Treat the statement as a [Publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Publication-statement/). 

## 5.25.34 Statements relating to publication and to distribution or manufacture

<a name="5.25.34.1">5.25.34.1</a> If the resource bears statements relating both to publication and to distribution or manufacture, determine whether or not the statements are grammatically separable. 

<a name="5.25.34.2">5.25.34.2</a> If a distribution statement is grammatically separable, treat the statement as a distribution statement. 

<a name="5.25.34.3">5.25.34.3</a>  If grammatically inseparable, transcribe them as a [Publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Publication-statement/). 

>Example:  
><CITE>London : Printed for the author, and published by J. Bew, Pater-Noster-Row, MDCCLXXIX</CITE>

>Example:  
><CITE>Boston : Printed by Robert Hodge, for Nathaniel Coverly, in Newbury-Street, [1782]</CITE>

>Example:  
><CITE>Amstelodami : Ex officina et sumptibus Iudoci Hondii, [approximately 1630]</CITE>

<a name="5.25.34.4">5.25.34.4</a> If a statement with grammatically inseparable elements contains information relating both to the distribution of the resource and to the agents who have contributed to its intellectual or artistic content, use judgment in deciding whether to transcribe the statement as part of the distribution statement or as a [Statement of responsibility relating to title proper](/DCRMR/sor/Statement-of-responsibility-relating-to-title-proper/) (see [2.21.38.2](/DCRMR/sor/Statement-of-responsibility-relating-to-title-proper/#2.21.38.2)). Often the layout of the source will suggest the appropriate treatment.
