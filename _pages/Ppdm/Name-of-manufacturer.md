<a name="4.223.7.2">4.223.7.2</a> *Optionally*, if it is considered that the names are too numerous to list exhaustively, and that some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, the [Manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Manufacture-statement/) may be shortened by omitting all the names after the third. In such cases, use the mark of omission and supply after it in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission. Include the number of omitted manufacturers (or firms) in the supplied phrase.

>Example:  
><CITE>Printed by L. Nichols & Co., T. & J. Swords, E. Duyckinck [and 10 others]</CITE>

## 4.223.9 Supplied and conjectured names of manufacturers

<a name="4.223.9.1">4.223.9.1</a> If no name, address, or device of a manufacturer appears on the manifestation, supply the name of the manufacturer in square brackets if known. If the responsibility of a manufacturer for a particular manifestation is conjectured, either add a question mark to any supplied name or give the information in a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/). In any case of a supplied manufacturer give supporting evidence in a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/) (see [4.226.5.6](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#4.226.5.6)).

## 4.223.95 No supplied name of manufacturer

<a name="4.223.95.1">4.223.95.1</a> If no manufacturer’s name can be conjectured, record  “manufacturer not identified” in square brackets.

>Example:  
>Name of manufacturer: <CITE>[Barthelemy Multeau le jeune?]</CITE>  
>Note on manufacture statement: <CITE>Printer conjectured from the privilege at end, in which the Archbishop cedes the privilege to "Barth. Multeau le jeune."</CITE>

If transcribing a manufacturer's  name as part of another element, do not abridge or expand the name of manufacturer simply because it repeats or omits information given elsewhere in the description.

## 4.223.97 Manufacturer names in more than one language or script

<a name="4.223.97.1">4.223.97.1</a> If the name of the manufacturer appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the statement in the language or script of the [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/), or if this criterion does not apply, transcribe the statement that appears first. Transcribe the remaining statement(s) as parallel statements (see [Parallel name of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Parallel-name-of-manufacturer/)). Make a [Note on manufacturer statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacturer-statement/) to indicate the original position on the source of any transposed statements (see [4.226.6.2](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacturer-statement/#4.226.6.2)).
