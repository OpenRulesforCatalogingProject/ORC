Transcribe them as subsequent statements of manufacture only when they are not linked by connecting words or phrases.

>Example:  
><CITE>Lovejoy, Son & Co., electrotypers & stereotypers, 15 Vandewate Street, N.Y.S.W. ; Green, printer and stereotyper, 16 and 18 Jacob Street, New-York</CITE>

<a name="5.32.34.2">5.32.34.2</a> *Optionally*, if it is considered that the names are too numerous to list exhaustively, and that some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, the [Manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Manufacture-statement/) may be shortened by omitting all the names after the third. In such cases, use the mark of omission and supply after it in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission. Include the number of omitted manufacturers (or firms) in the supplied phrase.

>Example:  
><CITE>Printed by L. Nichols & Co., T. & J. Swords, E. Duyckinck [and 10 others]</CITE>

<a name="5.32.35.1">5.32.35.1</a> If the manifestation is issued in more than one physical part and the name or form of name of the  manufacturer changes in the course of publication, transcribe the [Manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Manufacture-statement/) of the first or earliest part and give the [Manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Manufacture-statement/) of the later part(s) in a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/) (see [5.34.33.5](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.33.5)).

## 5.32.36 Supplied and conjectured names of manufacturers

<a name="5.32.36.1">5.32.36.1</a> If no name, address, or device of a manufacturer appears on the manifestation, supply the name of the manufacturer in square brackets if known. If the responsibility of a manufacturer for a particular manifestation is conjectured, either add a question mark to any supplied name or give the information in a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/). In any case of a supplied manufacturer give supporting evidence in a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/) (see [5.34.33.6](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.33.6)).

## 5.32.37 No supplied name of manufacturer

<a name="5.32.37.1">5.32.37.1</a> If no manufacturer’s name can be conjectured, record  “manufacturer not identified” in square brackets.

>Example:  
>Name of manufacturer: <CITE>[Barthelemy Multeau le jeune?]</CITE>  
>Note on manufacture statement: <CITE>Printer conjectured from the privilege at end, in which the Archbishop cedes the privilege to "Barth. Multeau le jeune."</CITE>

If transcribing a manufacturer's  name as part of another element, do not abridge or expand the name of manufacturer simply because it repeats or omits information given elsewhere in the description.

## 5.32.39 Manufacturer names in more than one language or script

<a name="5.32.39.1">5.32.39.1</a> If the name of the manufacturer appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the statement in the language or script of the [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/), or if this criterion does not apply, transcribe the statement that appears first. Transcribe the remaining statement(s) as parallel statements (see [Parallel name of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Parallel-name-of-manufacturer/)). Make a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/) to indicate the original position on the source of any transposed statements (see [5.34.34.2](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.34.2)).
