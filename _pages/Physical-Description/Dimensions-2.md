## 5.6B Definition and scope

<a name="5.6B.1">5.6B.1</a> A measurement of a carrier or a container of a manifestation.

<a name="5.6B.2">5.6B.2</a> Dimensions include measurements of height, width, depth, length, gauge, and diameter.


## 5.6C Sources of information

<a name="5.6C.1">5.6C.1</a> Take information for this element from the manifestation itself.

## 5.6D General rule

<a name="5.6D.1">5.6D.1</a> Record the dimensions of a manifestation (based on the copy in hand) in centimeters, using the metric symbol cm. Round a fraction of a centimeter up to the next full centimeter. If a manifestation measures less than 10 centimeters, record the dimensions in millimeters, using the metric symbol mm. 

```18 cm```

(*Comment:* A publication measuring 17.1 centimeters in height)

```99 mm```

(*Comment:*  A publication measuring between 98 and 99 millimeters in height)

If one of the measurements would normally be given in millimeters and one in centimeters, record both measurements in millimeters. 

```95 x 120 mm```

If more than one exemplar of the manifestation is known, and the dimensions of the different exemplars vary, record the dimensions as issued, if they can be determined. Otherwise, record the dimensions of the largest known exemplar.  Record the dimensions of the other exemplars in note on dimensions of item.

## 5.6E Volumes

<a name="5.6E.1">5.6E.1</a> **Height.** If a volume is bound, measure the height of the binding. 

```27 cm```

When the height of the text block differs by 3 centimeters or more from the height of the binding, specify both.

```text block 12 cm, in binding 20 cm```

<a name="5.6E.2">5.6E.2</a> **Width.**  If the width of a volume is greater than the height, or less than half the height, record give the height x width. 

```20 x 32 cm```

```20 x 8 cm```

## 5.6F Differing sizes

<a name="5.6F.1">5.6F.1</a> If the volumes of a multipart set differ in size, record the smallest or smaller size and the largest or larger size, separated by a hyphen.

```24-28 cm```

<a name="5.6F.2">5.6F.2</a> If the volume contains separate text blocks of varying dimensions, record the height (or height Ã— width) of the binding only. If considered important, record this information in note on the dimensions of manifestation or [note on dimensions of item](https://ladylazarus3.github.io/Test2/docs/Notes-on-Items/Note-on-dimensions-of-item-2#85d-differing-sizes).

## 5.6G Single-sheet publications

<a name="5.6G.1">5.6G.1</a> For a single-sheet publication issued unfolded, record give the height x width. 

```32 x 25 cm```

If a sheet is issued in folded form, but is designed to be used unfolded (e.g., with the chief part occupying a whole side of the sheet), add the dimensions of the sheet when folded.

```1 sheet ([1] page) ; 22 x 28 cm, folded to 22 x 10 cm```

If the sheet is not folded as issued, or in cases of uncertainty, do not record the height x width when folded. If the folded dimensions are important, record this information in [note on dimensions of item](https://ladylazarus3.github.io/Test2/docs/Notes-on-Items/Note-on-dimensions-of-item-2#85e-single-sheet-publications).

```24 x 38 cm```

```Note on dimensions of item: Folded by later owner to 24 x 19 cm```

<a name="5.6G.2">5.6G.2</a> When describing other folded sheets designed to be used as folded (see [extent of manifestation](https://ladylazarus3.github.io/Test2/docs/Physical-Description/Extent-of-manifestation/])), record the height of the sheet when folded.

```1 folded sheet ([8] panels) ; 18 cm```

## 5.6H Containers

<a name="5.6H.1">5.6H.1</a> If a container was issued with the resource, record the the height x width x depth of the container, if considered important. Record these dimensions in addition to the dimensions of the volume or sheet.

```33 cm, in box 34 x 25 x 6 cm```

<a name="5.6H.2">5.6H.2</a> If the container was not issued with the resource, do not record the dimensions of the container in the dimensions element.  In situations of uncertainty, assume that the container was not issued with the resource. Record the dimensions of the container in a [note on dimensions of item](https://ladylazarus3.github.io/Test2/docs/Notes-on-Items/Note-on-dimensions-of-item-2#85f-containers), if considered important.
