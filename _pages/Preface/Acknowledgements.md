Writing a standard is intensive work performed by dedicated volunteers. Every member of the editorial group has volunteered their time to this effort while also working full time jobs and balancing their personal lives. The initial release of DCRMR was prepared in truly extraordinary circumstances. The release of the new RDA Toolkit in 2019 necessitated a full change in direction, leading the editorial group to create a new standard in roughly 18 months. During this time, we faced the COVID-19 pandemic and uprisings across the United States. Throughout this, the editorial group worked tirelessly to bring this work to fruition. No one accepts editorial responsibilities anticipating these challenges. From the bottom of my heart, thank you to every member of the RBMS RDA Editorial Group from its inception to the present:

|---|---|
| Elizabeth Hobart, editor (2019-present) | Francis Lapka |
| Michelle Mascaro, editor (2017-2020) | Deborah J. Leslie |
| Amy Brown | Iris O’Brien |
| kalan Knudson Davis | Tammy Druash |
| Jessica Grzegorski | Ryan Hildebrand |
| Elizabeth O’Keefe | Audrey Pearson |
| Amy Tims |

This work was not performed solely by the editorial group. Thanks as well to all of the John Attig and Robert Maxwell for laying the foundation of this work.

Our heartfelt thanks go to the Folger Shakespeare Library for generously providing meeting space for editorial group meetings in June 2019 and the Lewis Walpole Library for hosting biannual meetings of the Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials Task Force from 2014-2017. A special thank you to Ellen Cordes in particular for arranging the Walpole meeting, without which the DCRM Task Force would not have been able to complete their charge.

Thanks also to Francis Lapka and Elizabeth Adams for investigating hosting options for DCRMR. Your work ensured a sustainable, usable home for DCRMR. 

Finally, I want to acknowledge our keepers of the text and editor. Audrey Pearson served as keeper of the text from 2014. After Audrey completed her editorial group term in 2019, Amy Tims took over this responsibility, ensuring editorial consistency for the emergent standard. kalan Knudson Davis joined as co-keeper in 2020 and led the migration of the text to GitHub. It is no exaggeration to say that this work could not have been completed without kalan’s support. Finally, a huge thank you to Michelle Mascaro, who served as editor from July 2017 until June 2020. The success of this text and final publication could not have been done without her tireless work for years.
