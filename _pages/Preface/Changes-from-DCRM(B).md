All instructions are mapped to RDA elements. As RDA elements are often more granular than areas of description in AACR2, this has often led to more granularity. For example, in DCRM(B), local notes were limited to general notes (7B19.1), provenance (7B19.2), and bindings (7B19.3). In DCRMR, notes on items appear in a separate chapter and are expanded to include custodial history, extent of item, and others. 

RDA terminology is generally used throughout, replacing terms such as “the publication” with “the resource” or “the manifestation,” or changing “copy” to “item” or “exemplar of manifestation.” Reflecting the RDA principle of common usage, the abbreviations “i.e.” and “sic” are retained, as they are commonly used in the rare materials community.

A new introductory section on “Data Provenance” has been added, which corresponds to General Rules 0C (Chief Source of Information) and 0D (Prescribed Sources of Information) in DCRM(B). 

DCRMR departs slightly from the DCRM practice of structuring the manuals according to the ISBD areas of description by splitting title and statement of responsibility into two chapters and adding a new chapter for item-specific notes. Notes pertaining to a specific element (e.g., Note on title) will now be found in the chapter for that element instead of the general note chapter. Information on prescribed punctuation has been removed from individual chapters and collocated in the introduction.

Some appendices have been removed. Appendix F (Title Access Points) has been integrated with the main text. Appendix G (Early Letterforms and Symbols) has been incorporated in Transcription. Appendix H (Individual and Special Issues of Serials) will be incorporated in a future iteration. Catalogers should continue to consult Appendix H of DCRM(B) for the time being.
