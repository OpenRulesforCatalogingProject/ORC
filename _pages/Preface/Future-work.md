Please comment about errata on the [Preface errata page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KSt090ycV2BCt6I9vIpcknGrQcyXAK8WtRKg_WvYDEA/edit#heading=h.9jw77wuk8mmu){:target="_blank"}.

This initial release includes only instructions for cataloging books. Additional formats will be added as  are developed.

Due to coordination with other organizations, notably the PCC, certain sections are being skipped for now, including [Precataloging Decisions](/DCRMR/introduction/#i019-precataloging-decisions), [MARC 21 Descriptive Conventions Code](/DCRMR/appendices/Appendix-a/), [Collection-Level Records](/DCRMR/appendices/Appendix-b/), [Core-Level Records](/DCRMR/appendices/Appendix-c/), and [Minimal-Level Records](/DCRMR/appendices/Appendix-d/). The [Glossary](/DCRMR/glossary/) is still in development and will be incorporated in a future release.
