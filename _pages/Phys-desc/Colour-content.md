# 5.204.3-5.202.5 DCRM Elaboration on scope

## 5.204.3 Printed color

<a name="5.204.3.1">5.204.3.1</a> Treat illustrations printed with a tint block (e.g., chiaroscuro woodcuts, tinted lithographs) as color illustrations.

<a name="5.204.3.2">5.204.3.2</a> If both the text and illustrations are printed in a single color, do not describe the illustrations as “color.” Make a note on the color of the ink if considered important (see [details of colour content](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-colour-content/), [5.205.4.1](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-colour-content/#5.205.4.1)).

<a name="5.204.3.3">5.204.3.3</a> In general, do not record printed color unless it appears in illustrations.  Make a note on the color of ink in textual matter if considered important (see [details of colour content](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-colour-content/), [5.205.4.2](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-colour-content/#5.205.4.2)). 

<a name="5.204.3.4">5.204.3.4</a> For incunabula, make a note on color printing if present (see [details of colour content](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-colour-content/), [5.205.X.X](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-colour-content/#5.205.4.3)).

## 5.204.4 Hand coloring in printed resources

<a name="5.204.4.1">5.204.4.1</a> “Hand-colored” material is material to which color is applied in a separate production stage by brush, stencil, or another manually applied method. 

<a name="5.204.4.2">5.204.4.2</a> Make a note on the presence or absence of hand coloring in an item if considered important (see [modification of item](/DCRMR/Notes-on-items/Modification-of-item/), [8.21.X.X](/DCRMR/Notes-on-items/Modification-of-item/#8.21.X.X)).

<a name="5.204.4.3">5.204.4.3</a> Exercise caution in recording hand coloring as an attribute of the manifestation in colour content or [details of colour content](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-colour-content/).

<a name="5.204.4.4">5.204.4.4</a> If there is strong evidence that all copies of the resource were issued with hand coloring applied before distribution, record the presence of color as colour content (see [5.205.5.1](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-colour-content/#5.205.5.1)). Evidence for hand-coloring applied before distribution may include statements within the resource itself or scholarly research. In general, do not treat the presence of hand coloring in a single item as evidence that the edition was issued with hand coloring. In case of doubt, assume that not all copies were issued with hand coloring applied before distribution.

<a name="5.204.4.5">5.204.4.5</a> If there is strong evidence that some copies of the resource were issued with hand-coloring applied before distribution, and some without, record this information as [details of colour content](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-colour-content/) instead of as colour content (see [5.205.5.2](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-colour-content/#5.205.5.2)).

<a name="5.204.5.1">5.204.5.1</a> Do not record the presence of color in base materials (e.g. paper) as color content (see X.X.X.X) Make a note if considered important (see [details of colour content](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-colour-content/), [5.205.6.1](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-colour-content/#5.205.6.1)).
