# 5.204.3-5.202.5 DCRM Elaboration on scope

## 5.204.3 Printed color

<a name="5.204.3.1">5.204.3.1</a> Treat illustrations printed with a tint block (e.g., chiaroscuro woodcuts, tinted lithographs) as color illustrations.

<a name="5.204.3.2">5.204.3.2</a> If both the text and illustrations are printed in a single color, do not describe the illustrations as “color.” Make a note on the color of the ink if considered important (see [Details of color content](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-color-content/), [6.235.31.1](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-color-content/#6.235.31.1)).

<a name="5.204.3.3">5.204.3.3</a> In general, do not record printed color unless it appears in illustrations.  Make a note on the color of ink in textual matter if considered important (see [Details of color content](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-color-content/), [6.235.31.2](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-color-content/#6.235.31.2)). 

<a name="5.204.3.4">5.204.3.4</a> For incunabula, make a note on color printing if present (see [Details of color content](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-color-content/), [6.235.31.3](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-color-content/#6.235.31.3)).

## 5.204.4 Hand coloring in printed resources

<a name="5.204.4.1">5.204.4.1</a> “Hand-colored” material is material to which color is applied in a separate production stage by brush, stencil, or another manually applied method. 

<a name="5.204.4.2">5.204.4.2</a> Make a note on the presence or absence of hand coloring in an item if considered important (see [Modification of item](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Modification-of-item/), [9.41.3.2](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Modification-of-item/#9.41.3.2)).

<a name="5.204.4.3">5.204.4.3</a> Exercise caution in recording hand coloring as an attribute of the manifestation in color content or [Details of color content](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-color-content/).

<a name="5.204.4.4">5.204.4.4</a> If there is strong evidence that all copies of the resource were issued with hand coloring applied before distribution, record the presence of color as [Details of color content](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-color-content/) (see [6.235.33.1](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-color-content/#6.235.33.1)). Evidence for hand-coloring applied before distribution may include statements within the resource itself or scholarly research. In general, do not treat the presence of hand coloring in a single item as evidence that the edition was issued with hand coloring. In case of doubt, assume that not all copies were issued with hand coloring applied before distribution.

<a name="5.204.4.5">5.204.4.5</a> If there is strong evidence that some copies of the resource were issued with hand-coloring applied before distribution, and some without, record this information as [Details of color content](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-color-content/) instead of as color content (see [6.235.33.2](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-color-content/#6.235.33.2)).

## 5.204.5 Color of base material

<a name="5.204.5.1">5.204.5.1</a> Do not record the presence of color in base materials (e.g. paper) as color content. Make a note if considered important (see [Details of color content](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-color-content/), [6.235.35.1](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-color-content/#6.235.35.1)).
