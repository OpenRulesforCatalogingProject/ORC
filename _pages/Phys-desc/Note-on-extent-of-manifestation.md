## 5.201.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="5.201.2.1">5.201.2.1</a> A note on manifestation that provides information on the extent of a manifestation.

## 5.201.3 General rule

<a name="5.201.3.1">5.201.3.1</a> Make a note on details of extent that are not already included in extent of manifestation if considered important.

> Example:  
> Note on extent of manifestation: Volumes numbered: `1, 2A, 2B, 2C, 3`

<a name="5.201.3.2">5.201.3.2</a> If the leaves are numbered on one side but  printed on both  sides, record this fact in a note on extent of manifestation.

> Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: `48 leaves`  
> Note on extent of manifestation: `Numbered leaves with text on both sides`

---
> Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: `[8], 260, [2] leaves`  
> Note on extent of manifestation: `Numbered leaves with text on both sides`

<a name="5.201.3.3">5.201.3.3</a> Make a note on extent of manifestation to explain that pages, etc. are numbered in words or other non-alphanumeric characters.

<a name="5.201.3.4">5.201.3.4</a> Record the presence of blank pages in a normally imposed single-folded (i.e. four-page) sheet.

> Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: `1, [3] pages`  
> Note on extent of manifestation: `Last three pages are blank`

---
> Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: `[4] pages`  
> Note on extent of manifestation: `Folded single sheet; last three pages are blank`

<a name="5.201.3.5">5.201.3.5</a> If the manifestation has duplicate sequences of paging, as is sometimes the case with manifestations having parallel texts, record both pagings and make an explanatory note on extent of manifestation.

> Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: `xii, [1], 35, 35, [1] p.`  
> Note on extent of manifestation: `Opposite pages bear duplicate numbering`

---
> Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: `[3], 2-11, 2-11, 12 pages, 13-19, 21 leaves, 22-44, [1] pages`  
> Note on extent of manifestation: `Page numbers 2-11 are duplicated on facing pages; 13-18 and 21 are folding letterpress tables, numbered as leaves; pages 22-44 start numbering on recto and are conventionally numbered`

---
> Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: `[1], vii, vii, [2], vii, vii, 95, 95, 94-131, 94-131, [3] pages`  
> Note on extent of manifestation: `Text in English and French on opposite pages, numbered in duplicate`

---
> Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: `[8], 334, [2], 32 pages`  
> Note on extent of manifestation: `"Prima elementa linguae Syriacae Iesu-Christo vernaculae ... per Iohannem Gasbarum Myricaeum Themarensem Hennembergico-Francum," 32 pages at end, has separate title page and is bound back-to-front. Title in Syriac precedes Latin title`

<a name="5.201.3.6">5.201.3.6</a> If a volume has pagination of its own and also bears the pagination of a larger resource of which it is a part, record the paging of the individual volume. Record the pagination of the larger sequence in a note on extent of manifestation.

> Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: `16 pages`  
> Note on extent of manifestation: `Pages 4-16 also numbered 196-208`

<a name="5.201.3.7">5.201.3.7</a> If a volume has pagination of its own and also bears the pagination of a larger resource of which it is a part, record the paging of the individual volume. Record the pagination of the larger sequence in a note on extent of manifestation.

> Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: `16 pages`  
> Note on extent of manifestation: `Pages 4-16 also numbered 196-208`

<a name="5.201.3.8">5.201.3.8</a> If the extent is not fully recorded in the extent of manifestation element (when, e.g., the sequences are exceedingly numerous), record all the sequences in a note on extent of manifestation if considered important.

<a name="5.201.3.9">5.201.3.9</a> If misleading or incorrect numbering is recorded in the extent element, provide an explanatory note on extent of manifestation if considered important.

> Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: `564 [that is, 56] leaves`  
> Note on extent of manifestation: `Leaf 56 wrongly numbered 564`

<a name="5.201.3.91">5.201.3.91</a> Make a note on extent of manifestation to indicate any title page counted as a plate.

> Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: `112 pages, [1] leaf of plates`  
> Note on extent of manifestation: `Plate has engraved title page on recto and blank verso`

<a name="5.201.3.92">5.201.3.92</a> Make a note on extent of manifestation to indicate any folded letterpress leaves if considered important.

> Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: `[10], 199 [i.e. 203], [33] pages, [3] folded leaves of plates`  
> Note on extent of manifestation: `The folded leaves are letterpress tables not included in signature statement`

<a name="5.201.3.93">5.201.3.93</a> Always record the presence of double leaves in a note on extent of manifestation.

> Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: `[2], 86, [2] pages`  
> Note on extent of manifestation: `Printed on double leaves, with uncut fold at the fore edge`

> Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: `[4], 28 pages, [86] leaves of plates`  
> Note on extent of manifestation: `Some plates printed on double leaves`

<a name="5.201.3.94">5.201.3.94</a> If the paging or foliation of a complete exemplar of the manifestation cannot be ascertained, record in a note on extent of manifestation that the extent is based on an incomplete exemplar.

<a name="5.201.3.95">5.201.3.95</a> Make a note on extent of manifestation indicating that a manifestation was issued in fascicles intended to be bound into one or more physical units.

<a name="5.201.3.96">5.201.3.96</a> *Optionally,* if the pagination of a manifestation in more than one physical unit is not continuous, record the number of pages, leaves, or columns of each unit either in parentheses after the number of units or in a note on extent of manifestation.

<a name="5.201.3.97">5.201.3.97</a> If a publication planned for more than one physical unit has been or appears to have been discontinued before completion, make a note on extent of manifestation indicating that no more units have been issued.

## 5.201.4 Signatures

<a name="5.201.4.1">5.201.4.1</a> **General rule.** Make a note giving details of the signatures of a volume if considered important.  Record these signature details according to the formula in Philip Gaskell's A New Introduction to Bibliography (see pages 328-332), insofar as typographical facilities permit. Preface this note with the word “Signatures” and a colon.

> Example:  
> Signatures: `[A]4 B-C4 D2 E-G4 H2`

---
> Example:  
> Signatures: `pi⁴(-pi4) A-B⁶ C⁴ a⁶ b⁸, ²A-S⁶ T-V⁴ 2A-2V⁶ 3A-3V⁶ 4A-4U⁶ 5A-5Z⁶ a⁶ 2a⁶ *⁶ **⁸. Leaves 2N3-2N4 missigned 2N1-2N2; leaves 2N1-2N2 unsigned`

---
> Example:  
> Signatures: `pi⁴ a-i⁸ chi²`

---
> Example:  
> Signatures: `1-30⁸ 31⁴ 32-35⁸ (31₄, 35₈ blank)`

---
> Example:  
> Signatures: `[1-4⁸][5-6⁶][7⁸]  
> (*Comment:* Volume is completely unsigned)`

In general, record signatures for incunabula, especially if identical signatures are not given in a standard bibliographic source. In general, also record signatures when a volume has no pagination or foliation.

<a name="5.201.4.2">5.201.4.2</a> **Unavailable characters.** If the gatherings are signed with a mark of contraction (see [transcription](/DCRMR/books/general-rules/Transcription/)) that cannot be reproduced using available typographical facilities, substitute the spelled out form and enclose it in square brackets.

> Example:  
> Signatures: A-F⁸ G⁶ a-z⁸ &⁸ [con]⁸ [rum]⁸ 2a-2y⁸

If the gatherings are signed with other unavailable characters, substitute a descriptive term or an abbreviation for that term if a standard one exists.

> Example:  
> Signatures: [dagger]⁸ a-q⁸  
> (Comment: Gathering is signed with ![Dagger](/assets/pictures/phys-desc/Dagger.jpg "Dagger")))

> Example:  
> Signatures: *⁸ [double dagger]⁸ A-M⁸ N⁴  
> (Comment: Gathering is signed with ![Double-dagger](/assets/pictures/phys-desc/Double-dagger.jpg "Double-dagger")))

> Example:  
> Signatures: [manicule]⁶ A⁸ B⁶ C⁸ d-g⁶/⁸ h-k⁶ L-M⁶  
> Signatures: [fist]⁴ A-D⁸ E⁸(±E2) F-G⁸ H⁴ I²  
> (Comment: Gathering is signed with )

> Example:
> Signatures: [fleuron]⁸ A⁴B-Y⁸
> (Comment: Gathering is signed with )

> Example:
> Signatures: [Maltese cross]⁶ A-X⁸ 2A-2P⁸ 2Q⁴
> (Comment: Gathering is signed with )
	
> Example:
> Signatures: [par.]⁸ A⁸(-A1)B-E⁸ F²
> (Comment: Gathering is signed with )

> Example:
> Signatures: [par.]⁴ 2[sec.]⁴ 3[sec.]² A-3P⁴
> (Comment: Gatherings are signed with  and )
