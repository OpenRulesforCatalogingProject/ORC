<a name="chapter#.entity#.3.1">chapter#.entity#.3.1</a> [Text of instruction with reference to another completed page via a see reference]  (see [chapter#.entity#.section#.instruction#](/DCRMR/books/chapter-name/Name-of-entity-featured-on-the-page/#chapter#.entity#.section#.instruction#)).

<a name="chapter#.entity#.3.2">chapter#.entity#.3.2</a> [Text of instruction with reference to another **INCOMPLETE** page via a see reference]  (see [chapter#.entity#.X.X](/DCRMR/books/chapter-name/Name-of-entity-featured-on-the-page/#chapter#.entity#.X.X)).  This is so we can search the string "X.X" in the documentation and update the instances as pages come online.
