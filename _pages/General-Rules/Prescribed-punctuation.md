The PCC has issued [guidelines for minimally punctuated records](https://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/documents/PCC%20Guidelines%20for%20Minimally%20Punctuated%20MARC%20Data%20v.1.1.docx), effective January 2020. Catalogers creating DCRMR records should apply the punctuation practices of their own institutions, where applicable. Libraries applying ISBD punctuation may apply the following guidelines for prescribed punctuation:

<a name="0.3.1">0.3.1</a> Precede each mark of prescribed punctuation by a space and follow it by a space, with the following exceptions: the comma, period, closing parenthesis, and closing square bracket are not preceded by a space; the opening parenthesis and opening square bracket are not followed by a space.

<a name="0.3.2">0.3.2</a> End paragraphs with normal punctuation (usually the period).

<a name="0.3.3">0.3.3</a> If an entire element is omitted from the bibliographic description (e.g., because it is not present in the source), also omit its corresponding prescribed punctuation. Do not use the mark of omission.

<a name="0.3.4">0.3.4</a> Precede each element, other than the first, by a period-space-dash-space (. -- ) unless the element begins a new paragraph.

<a name="0.3.5">0.3.5 Title.</a> Precede the title of a supplement or section by a period. Precede each parallel title by an equal sign. Precede each unit of other title information by a colon.

For manifestations with no collective title, separate the titles by a space-semicolon-space if the works are all by the same entity, even if the titles are linked by a collective word or phrase. If the individual works are by different entities or the authorship is in doubt, precede each title other than the first by a period and one space, unless a linking word or phrase is already present. Precede each statement of responsibility by a space-slash-space.

<a name="0.3.6">0.3.6 Statement of responsibility.</a> Precede the first statement of responsibility by a diagonal slash. Precede each subsequent statement of responsibility by a semicolon.

<a name="0.3.7">0.3.7 Edition.</a> Precede the edition statement by a period-space-dash-space. Precede a statement relating to a named revision of an edition by a comma. Precede the first statement of responsibility following an edition statement by a diagonal slash. Precede each subsequent statement of responsibility by a semicolon.

<a name="0.3.8">0.3.8 Production, publication, distribution, manufacture.</a> Precede production, publication, distribution, or manufacture statements by a period-space-dash-space. Precede a second or subsequently named place of production, publication, distribution, or manufacture by a semicolon, unless a linking word or phrase is given in the resource. Precede the name of the first producer, publisher, distributor, or manufacturer by a colon. Precede the name of a second and any subsequent name by a colon, unless a linking word or phrase is given in the resource. Precede the date of production, publication, distribution, or manufacture by a comma.

<a name="0.3.9">0.3.9 Physical description.</a> Precede an illustration statement by a colon. Precede the size by a semicolon. Enclose bibliographic format in parentheses. Precede a statement of accompanying material by a plus sign. Enclose physical details of accompanying material in parentheses.

<a name="0.3.10">0.3.10 Series.</a> Enclose each series statement in parentheses. Precede each parallel title by an equals sign. Precede other title information by a colon. Precede the first statement of responsibility by a diagonal slash. Precede each subsequent statement of responsibility by a semicolon. Precede the ISSN of a series or subseries by a comma. Precede the numbering within a series or subseries by a semicolon. Enclose a date following a numeric and/or alphabetic designation in parentheses. Precede the title of a subseries, or the designation for a subseries, by a period. Precede the title of a subseries following a designation for the subseries by a comma.

<a name="0.3.11">0.3.11 Notes.</a> Start a new paragraph for each note. End each paragraph with a period or other mark of final punctuation. Separate introductory wording from the main content of a note by a colon followed but not preceded by a space. 

<a name="0.3.12">0.3.12 Identifier.</a> Precede this element by a period-space-dash-space or start a new paragraph. Precede each repetition of this element by a period-space-dash-space. Precede terms of availability by a colon. Enclose a qualification to the standard number or terms of availability in parentheses.
