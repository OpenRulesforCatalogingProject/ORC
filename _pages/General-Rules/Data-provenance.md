## 0.2.1 Recording a content standard

<a name="0.2.1.1">0.2.1.1</a> See Appendix A. MARC 21 Descriptive Conventions Code (forthcoming) for guidance. **Note: At this time, a descriptive conventions code has not yet been approved for DCRMR.**

## 0.2.2-0.2.4 Basis of the description

### 0.2.2 General rule

<a name="0.2.2.1">0.2.2.1</a> Base the description on the item in hand.

### 0.2.3 Imperfect exemplars of a manifestation

<a name="0.2.3.1">0.2.3.1</a> A greater vulnerability to damage, defect, and loss means that rare materials, especially older printed materials, are less likely than modern materials to be in a perfect or complete state when they reach the cataloger. One of the cataloger’s tasks is to ascertain (within reasonable constraints) whether and how much the item in hand deviates from its original state as issued. Imperfections and defects are usually easy to spot. Harder to spot during casual examination are replacement leaves, plates, or sections from another exemplar of a manifestation, and the cataloger is not expected to verify the integrity of each leaf in a manifestation unless there is reason to suspect that the item in hand may have been made up, doctored, or falsified (“sophisticated”). Bibliographers’ and booksellers’ descriptions are the usual source of such information. For item-specific modifications, see [8.21.X.X](/DCRMR/books/notes-on-items/Modification-of-item/#8.21.X.X).

If describing an exemplar of a manifestation known to be imperfect, and details of a perfect (or more perfect) exemplar can be determined, base the description on the perfect exemplar. Do not use square brackets to record information present in the perfect exemplar but absent in the imperfect exemplar. Details of a perfect (or more perfect) exemplar may be determined by examining additional items, by examining facsimiles of perfect copies, or by referring to reliable descriptions in other sources. As appropriate, cite the source used for the description (see [7.223.X.X](/DCRMR/books/other-notes/Manifestation-described-in/#7.223.4.1)). Make a local note describing the imperfection of the item in hand (see [8.21.X.X](/DCRMR/books/notes-on-items/Modification-of-item/#8.21.X.X)).

<a name="0.2.3.2">0.2.3.2</a> **Details of a perfect exemplar cannot be determined.** If no reliable evidence of the details of a perfect exemplar is available, describe the imperfect item as it is. Use the mark of omission enclosed in square brackets to indicate lacunae as needed (see [0.5.10](/DCRMR/books/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.14)). Make a Note on manifestation indicating that the description is based on an imperfect exemplar (see [7.20.X.X](/DCRMR/books/other-notes/Note-on-manifestation/#7.20.X.X)).

>Example:  
>`London : Pub. 13th June 1776 by W. Humphrey, Gerrard Street, Soho`  
>Note on publication statement: `Imprint from British Museum. Dept. of Prints and Drawings. Catalogue of prints and drawings in the British Museum (1870-1954) (George)`  
>Note on modification of item: `Imperfect; trimmed below title, removing imprint`

---
>Example:  
>Carta de [...] sitio de Puebla`  
>Note on manifestation: `Description based on an imperfect copy; section of map missing at top, affecting text`

<a name="0.2.3.3">0.2.3.3</a> **Multipart monographs or serials.** If the first volume or issue is lacking or imperfect to the degree that it impedes identification or access, and details of a perfect (or more perfect) exemplar cannot be determined, then base the description on the earliest available volume or issue that can supply the details necessary for the description.

<a name="0.2.3.4">0.2.3.4</a>  **Resources for which the concept of perfect exemplar does not apply.** If describing resources for which the concept of perfect exemplar does not apply, describe the imperfect resource as it is. Such resources include unpublished items, such as manuscript maps and original works of art, as well as unique books or unique assemblages of published items, such as composite atlases. Use the mark of omission enclosed in square brackets to indicate lacunae as needed (see [0.5.10](/DCRMR/books/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.14)). Make a Note on manifestation describing the imperfection of the resource in hand (see [7.20.X.X](/DCRMR/books/other-notes/Note-on-manifestation/#7.20.X.X)).

### 0.2.4 Dust jackets

<a name="0.2.4">0.2.4</a> In the context of rare materials cataloging, dust jackets issued by the publisher are appropriately considered part of a manifestation. Dust jackets often contain valuable information not found in any other source in the manifestation. Their easy detachability, however, coupled with their original function as protection for the binding only until it was safely in the hands of a reader, pose considerable difficulties for the rare materials cataloger. A fine dust jacket from a poor copy may have been exchanged with a poor dust jacket from a fine copy; the dust jacket of an original printing may end up on the exemplar of a later manifestation, and so on. When considering whether to transcribe information that appears only on a dust jacket, consider that the dust jacket was issued with the resource, unless there is reason to suspect otherwise.

## 0.2.5 Preferred source of information

<a name="0.2.5.1">0.2.5.1</a> For resources that consist of more than one page, leaf, sheet, or card, use the title page, title sheet, or title card as the preferred source of information. If information traditionally given on the title page is given on two facing pages or on pages on successive leaves, with or without repetition, treat all of these pages as the preferred source and make a note.

*Exception:* Treat half-titles or added non-letterpress title pages as separate sources of information.

Treat facing pages or pages on successive leaves in different languages or scripts as a single source of information.

However, if the manifestation bears a cover or case issued with the resource that contains all the elements typically given on a title page and has more recent information than that provided on the title page, title sheet, or title card (e.g., a later edition statement and publication date), choose the cover as the preferred source of information. Make a note to indicate that the cover has been chosen as the preferred source (see [1.26.X.X](/DCRMR/books/title/Note-on-title/#1.26.X.X)).

>Example:  
>`Poetry of animated nature illustrated : a chaste, interesting and instructive present for juveniles. -- Second edition. -- Philadelphia : Published by Robert A. Smith, 1848`  
>Note on title: `Title, edition statement, and imprint taken from printed wrapper. Title page reads: Poetry of animated nature illustrated. In a series of numbers. Philadelphia: Published by Robert A. Smith, 1846`

<a name="0.2.5.2">0.2.5.2</a> **Single-sheet resources.** If the manifestation consists of a single sheet, use as the preferred source of information the first of the following:

+ the whole sheet, recto and verso, including any permanently affixed labels issued with the resource
+ an original container or case issued with the resource (e.g., a  portfolio, cover, or envelope).

<a name="0.2.5.3">0.2.5.3</a> **Multipart monographs.** Choose as the preferred source of information a source of information identifying the manifestation as a whole, preferring a source that has a collective title, regardless of whether or not the parts are numbered.

<a name="0.2.5.4">0.2.5.4</a> **No title page, title sheet, or title card.** For manifestations issued without a title page, title sheet, or title card (and for manifestations issued *with* a title page when the title page is missing and no reliable description of it is available), if a single title proper is available in a single source within the manifestation, use this source as the preferred source. If the same title proper is available in more than one source within the manifestation, choose as the title page substitute the source that supplies the most additional information. If different titles, or differing forms of the same title, appear within the manifestation, choose as the preferred source the source within the manifestation in which the information is most formally presented. If there is no formal presentation of a title within the manifestation or if differing titles are presented equally formally, choose as the preferred source one of the following, in this order of preference:

+ a colophon
+ a source within the preliminaries
+ a caption
+ a cover integral to the resource
+ a source elsewhere within the resource

Make a note indicating the source chosen as the title page substitute (see [1.26.X.X](/DCRMR/books/title/Note-on-title/#1.26.X.X)).

Hereafter in these rules, “title page” means “title page or title page substitute.”

<a name="0.2.5.5">0.2.5.5</a> **More than one preferred source of information.** If there is more than one source of information that qualifies as the preferred source of information for the manifestation, choose as the preferred source of information one of the following, applying the first applicable criterion:

+ **Preferred sources of information for the reproduction and the original.**
If the manifestation is a facsimile or reproduction of an original manifestation and the manifestation contains a preferred source of information for the reproduction as well as a preferred source of information for the original, then use the source for the reproduction as the preferred source.
+ **Preferred sources of information with different dates.**
If a manifestation is not a multipart monograph or serial and the manifestation contains preferred sources of information with different dates, then use the source with the later or latest date.
+ **Preferred sources of information in letterpress and non-letterpress.**
If the manifestation contains one preferred source that is in letterpress and one that is not (e.g., engraved), use the source that is in letterpress.
+ **Preferred sources of information in different languages or scripts.**
If the manifestation contains preferred sources in more than one language or script, use as the preferred source (in this order of preference):
     1. the source in the language or script that corresponds to the language or script of the content of the resource
     2. the source in the language or script that corresponds to the predominant language or script of the content of the resource
     3. the source in the language or script of translation, if the resource contains the same work in more than one language or script and translation is known to be the purpose of the resource
     4. the source in the original language or script of the content, if the resource contains the same content in more than one language or script and the original language or script can be identified
     5. the first occurring of the sources
     6. the source in the language or script preferred by the agency preparing the description, if the resource is formatted
+ **Order of sources of information.**
If two title pages face one another, choose the one on the recto of its leaf. If two or more title pages follow one another, choose the first one.

Make a note indicating the source chosen as the preferred source of information if other than the usual title page, or, in a multipart manifestation, if other than the title page of the first volume.

## 0.2.6 Sources of information

<a name="0.2.6.1">0.2.4.1</a> The source(s) of information for each element are set out in preferred order below:

| Elements                                               | Sources of Information |
| ---------------------------                            | ---------------------- |
| Title                                                  | Title page |
| Statement of responsibility                            | Title page |
| Edition                                                | Title page, other preliminaries, colophon, dust jacket |
| Production, publication, distribution, and manufacture | Title page, other preliminaries, colophon, dust jacket |
| Physical description                                   | The whole manifestation |
| Series                                                 | Series title page, monograph title page, cover, dust jacket, rest of manifestation |
| Notes                                                  | Any source |
| Identifier                                             | Any source |

For additional guidance on sources of information for individual elements, see instructions for that element.

Transcribe information from the source for title, statement of responsibility, edition, publication, distribution, manufacture, and series only if it is present in the source of information for that element. In all cases in which information for these elements is taken from a source other than the title page (or series title page for series), make a note to indicate the source of information (see note instructions for individual elements).

## 0.2.7 Recording a source of information that is not the manifestation being described

<a name="0.2.7.1">0.2.7.1</a> If the manifestation does not provide a source of information for an element, take the information from one of the following sources (in order of preference):

+ a reference source (e.g., a bibliography or catalog)
+ other published descriptions of the manifestation (e.g., a dealer’s description, a prospectus)
+ any other available source (e.g., a container that is not issued with the manifestation itself or accompanying material that is not treated as part of the manifestation itself)

When the instructions specify transcription, indicate that the information is supplied from a source outside the manifestation itself by enclosing the information in square brackets.

If the source of information is not the manifestation that is being described, enclose the information in square brackets. Record a note to indicate the source of information.

>Example:  
>Title: `[The great triumphal chariot of Maximilian I]`  
>Note on title: `Title from Bartsch, 1001.339`   
>Comment: A separate note is used to provide a full citation for the reference to the published description.

*Optionally*, *if* consulting a potential source other than the manifestation being described *and* the potential source does not provide additional information, record a note to indicate that additional information was not found in the source.
