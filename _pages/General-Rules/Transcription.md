# 0.5 Transcription

## 0.5.0 General guidelines on transcription

<a name="0.5.0.1">0.5.0.1</a> Transcribe information in the form and order in which it is presented in the resource, according to these general rules, unless instructed otherwise by specific rules. Do not use the mark of omission to indicate transposition.

DCRMR normalizes punctuation and capitalization based on current conventions, with an optional exception in punctuation (see [0.5.31.5](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.31.5)). 

If nonnormalized transcription is considered important, follow [RDA Guidelines on basic transcription](https://beta.rdatoolkit.org/Guidance/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-fd2213e6-ae72-3e6f-8f0a-be3fc0e8d728){:target="_blank"}) and consistently apply it throughout the resource description.

## 0.5.1 Letters, diacritical marks, ligatures, symbols, and rebuses

### 0.5.12 Letters and diacritical marks

<a name="0.5.12.1">0.5.12.1</a> In general, transcribe letters and diacritical marks as they appear. Do not add accents and other diacritical marks not present in the manifestation. Convert earlier forms of letters and diacritical marks to their modern form (see [Early letterforms and symbols](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0515-early-letterforms-and-symbols), [0.5.15.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.15.1)).

<a name="0.5.12.2">0.5.12.2</a> *Optionally*, when converting uppercase to lowercase, add diacritical marks that are not present on the source of information in accordance with the pattern of usage in the text.

### 0.5.13 Ligatures

<a name="0.5.13.1">0.5.13.1</a> In most languages, including Latin, transcribe a ligature by giving its component letters separately. Do not, however, separate the component letters of **&aelig;** in Anglo-Saxon; **&oelig;** in French; or **&aelig;** and **&oelig;** in ancient or modern Scandinavian languages. 

### 0.5.14 Symbols, etc.

<a name="0.5.14.1">0.5.14.1</a> Replace symbols or other matter that cannot be reproduced using available typographical facilities with a cataloger's description in square brackets. Make a note if necessary.

For additional guidance on recording signs and symbols, see the [LC-PCC PS for 1.7.5](http://access.rdatoolkit.org/document.php?id=lcpschp1&target=lcps1-746#lcps1-746){:target="_blank"}.

>Example:  
><CITE>A.J. Garnerin, aeoronaute, inv. du parachute, né à Paris 1769, [death symbol] 1813</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*: A.J. GARNERIN, AERONAUTE, Inv. du Parachute, Né à Paris 1769 &#8224; 1813)

### 0.5.15 Early letterforms and symbols

<a name="0.5.15.1">0.5.15.1</a> Convert earlier forms of letters and symbols to their modern forms.

![Early letterforms and symbols](https://rbms-bsc.github.io/DCRMR/assets/pictures/transcription/early letterforms and symbols.png)

### 0.5.16 Brevigraphs

<a name="0.5.16.1">0.5.16.1</a> If brevigraphs (special marks of contraction in continuance of the manuscript tradition) have been used, expand affected words to their full form and enclose supplied letters in square brackets. The values of many contractions are dependent on context, with the most common values provided here.

![Brevigraphs, chart 1](https://rbms-bsc.github.io/DCRMR/assets/pictures/transcription/early contractions 01.png)

![Brevigraphs, chart 2](https://rbms-bsc.github.io/DCRMR/assets/pictures/transcription/early contractions 02.png)

![Brevigraphs, chart 3](https://rbms-bsc.github.io/DCRMR/assets/pictures/transcription/early contractions 03.png)

<a name="0.5.16.2">0.5.16.2</a> Make an explanatory note if necessary.

<a name="0.5.16.3">0.5.16.3</a> If a brevigraph standing for an entire word appears in the source, supply instead the word itself, enclosed in square brackets. Enclose each expansion or supplied word in its own set of square brackets.

>Example:  
><CITE>Sould by Will. Faithorne att [the] sign of [the] Shipp within Temple Bar</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*:  Sould by Will. Faithorne att ![ye](https://rbms-bsc.github.io/DCRMR/assets/pictures/transcription/ye.png) sign of ![ye](https://rbms-bsc.github.io/DCRMR/assets/pictures/transcription/ye.png) shipp within Temple Bar)

<a name="0.5.16.4">0.5.16.4</a> If the meaning of a brevigraph is conjectural or unknown, apply the bracketing conventions given in [Conjectural and indecipherable text](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0562-conjectural-and-indecipherable-text) (see [0.5.62.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.62.1)).

### 0.5.17 Rebuses

<a name="0.5.17.1">0.5.17.1</a> Replace pictures in rebuses with the intended words in square brackets.

Make an explanatory note.

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>The [Bute] interest in the [city], or, The [bridge] in the [hole]</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>Title in the form of a rebus. Bute represented as a boot in the rebus.</CITE>

### 0.5.18 [Key designations] 

<a name="0.5.18.1">0.5.18.1</a> Transcribe accidentals (flat and sharp signs, etc.) directly following the key letters being modified. Do not insert a space. 

>Example:  
><CITE>A&#9837; major</CITE>

<a name="0.5.18.2">0.5.18.2</a> If minor keys are represented by lowercase letters in the chief source, transcribe them as lowercase. Otherwise, record any letter(s) representing the key in uppercase.

## 0.5.2 Capitalization and conversion of case

### 0.5.21 Capitalization and conversaion of case: general rule

<a name="0.5.21.1">0.5.21.1</a> Convert letters to uppercase or lowercase according to the guidelines for [Capitalization](https://beta.rdatoolkit.org/Resource/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-f32d79b7-2177-300c-ae09-639ac89b5d49 "RDA: Capitalization") in the RDA Toolkit, with the following exceptions. 

For guidelines converting I or V to lowercase, or i, j, u, or v to uppercase, see [Letterforms I, V, i, j, u, and V](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0523-letterforms-i-v-i-j-u-and-v) ([0.5.23.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.23.1)).

### 0.5.22 Roman numerals

<a name="0.5.22.1">0.5.22.1</a> Do not convert case when transcribing roman numerals.

See also [Punctuation within roman numerals](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0534-punctuation-within-roman-numerals) ([0.5.34.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.34.1)).

### 0.5.23 Letterforms I, V, i, j, u, and v

<a name="0.5.23.1">0.5.23.1</a> If the rules for capitalization require converting I or V to lowercase, or i, j, u, or v to uppercase, follow the pattern of usage in the text to determine which letterform to use in the transcription. 

Establish the pattern of usage by examining text in the same typeface (i.e., roman, italic, or gothic) in the publication being described. Look for letters expressed in the opposite case from the letterforms to be converted, but having the same function (vowel or consonant) and same relative position (appearing in initial, medial, or final positions) as the letterforms to be converted. Begin by examining the remainder of the title page and then, if necessary, proceed to examine the body of the text in other parts of the resource in the same typeface. 

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>Les oeuures morales de Plutarque</CITE>  
>Statement of responsibility: <CITE>translatees de grec en françois, reueues et corrigees en plusieurs passages par le translateur</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*: LES OEVVRES MORALES DE PLVTARQVE, TRANSLATEES DE GREC EN FRANÇOIS, REVEVES ET corrigees en plusieurs passages par le translateur)  
>(*Comment*: In the publication, the body of the text in roman type shows consistent use of v for vowels or consonants in initial position and u for vowels or consonants elsewhere, e.g., "ville," "vn," "conuersation," "tout," and "entendu")

<a name="0.5.23.2">0.5.23.2</a> If the pattern of usage cannot be determined within a reasonable amount of time, use this conversion table as a solution of last resort.

**Converting uppercase letterforms**

| Uppercase letterform to be converted | Lowercase conversion |
| --- | ---| --- |
| I (vowel or consonant) anywhere in word | i | 
| II at end of word | ij | 
| II elsewhere in word | ii |
| V (vowel or consonant) at beginning of word | v |
| V (vowel or consonant) elsewhere in word	| u |

**Converting lowercase letterforms**

| Lowercase letterform to be converted | Uppercase conversion |
| --- | ---| --- |
| i (vowel or consonant) anywhere in word | I | 
| j (vowel or consonant) anywhere in word | I | 
| u (vowel or consonant) anywhere in word | V |
| v (vowel or consonant) anywhere in word | V |

<a name="0.5.23.3">0.5.23.3</a> If any letterform within the first five words of the title has been converted from I to j, from j to I, from V to u, or from u to V (the first six words if the title begins with an article), record a [Variant title](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title) using alternative forms of the title proper as needed (see [1.6.X.X](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title/#1.6.X.X)).

<a name="0.5.23.4">0.5.23.4</a> If the manifestation uses a gothic typeface that does not distinguish between the letters i/j or the letters u/v, transcribe the letters as i and v respectively.

### 0.5.24 Final capital "I" in Latin

<a name="0.5.24.1">0.5.24.1</a> Do not convert to lowercase a final capital I in Latin texts when the final I is uppercase and the immediately preceding letters in the word are lowercase or smaller capital letters. Since this usage is not merely typographic but affects meaning, the capital must be left in that form.

>Example:  
><CITE>M. AccI Plauti quae supersunt Comoediae</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*: M. AccI Plauti quae supersunt Comoediae)

>Example:  
><CITE>ValerI Andreae DesselI I.C. Bibliotheca Belgica</CITE>

<a name="0.5.24.2">0.5.24.2</a> If the letter occurs within the first five words of the title proper (the first six words if the title begins with an article), record a [Variant title](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title) for the form of title with the final capital I converted to ii (see [1.6.X.X](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title/#1.6.X.X)).

### 0.5.25 Chronograms

<a name="0.5.25.1">0.5.25.1</a> Capital letters occurring apparently at random or in a particular sequence may represent a chronogram. Where there is good reason to assume that a chronogram is being used, do not convert letters considered part of the chronogram from uppercase to lowercase, or from lowercase to uppercase.

>Example:  
><CITE>Ipso anno tertIo saeCVLarI typographIae DIVIno aVXILIo a gerManIs InVentae</CITE>

For guidance on recording the chronogram as a date element, see the instructions for specific types of dates as follows:
* For [Date of publication](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-publication/), see [4.205.4.2](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-publication/#4.205.4.2)
* For [Date of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-distribution/ ), see [4.215.4.2](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-distribution/#4.215.4.2)
* For [Date of manufacture](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-manufacture/), see [4.225.5.2](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-manufacture/#4.225.5.2)
* [Date of production]

## 0.5.3 Punctuation

### 0.5.31 Punctuation: general rule

<a name="0.5.31.1">0.5.31.1</a> Use modern punctuation conventions instead of transcribing punctuation as it appears on the source. 

>Example:  
><CITE>Perdito & Perdita, or, The man & woman of the people</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*: Perdito & Perdita—or—the Man & Woman of the People)

>Example:  
><CITE>A musical entertainment perform’d on November XXII, 1683</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*: A musical entertainment perform’d on November XXII. 1683)

<a name="0.5.31.2">0.5.31.2</a> If the cataloging agency applies ISBD punctuation, omit punctuation present on the source that occurs at the end of an element.

>Example:  
>Publication statement: <CITE>London : Printed for A. Millar, over-against Catharine-Street in the Strand, M,DCC,LI [1751]</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*: London: Printed for A. Millar, over-against Catharine-street in the Strand. M,DCC,LI.)

<a name="0.5.31.3">0.5.31.3</a> Omit or add punctuation as needed for clarity.

>Example:  
><CITE>Libres, libertad de cultos, libertad de palabra, libres de miseria, libres de temor</CITE>  
>(*Comment*: Commas added to represent breaks indicated by poster’s lettering style and word placement.)

<a name="0.5.31.4">0.5.31.4</a> **Punctuation integral to words and compound words**. Generally transcribe integral punctuation as it appears on the source (e.g., printers’ or night-club). Do not add or omit punctuation integral to the spelling of words and compound words. Apply the following sub, as appropriate:
* [Apostrophes](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0532-apostrophes) (see [0.5.32.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.32.1))
* [Hyphens](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0533-hyphens) (see [0.5.33.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.33.1))
* [Punctuation within roman numerals](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0534-punctuation-within-roman-numerals) (see [0.5.34.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.34.1))
* [Punctuation substituting for letters](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0538-punctuation-substituting-for-letters) (see [0.5.38.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.38.1))
* [Punctuation indicating an abbreviation](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#05385-punctuation-indicating-an-abbreviation) (see [0.5.385.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.385.1))

<a name="0.5.31.5">0.5.31.5</a> **Nonnormalized transcription**. *Optionally*, transcribe all punctuation as it appears on the source, with the exception of those marks covered in the following sub:
* [Ellipses](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0535-ellipses) (see [0.5.35.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.35.1))
* [Square brackets](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#05355-square-brackets) (see [0.5.355.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.355.1))
* [Virgules](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0536-virgules) (see [0.5.36.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.36.1))
* [Line endings](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0537-line-endings) (see [0.5.37.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.37.1))

>Example:  
><CITE>Perdito & Perdita—or—the Man & Woman of the People</CITE>

If a cataloging agency applies ISBD punctuation and the option for nonnormalized transcription is applied, then record both transcribed punctuation and prescribed punctuation, even if this results in double punctuation. (See also [Prescribed punctuation](/DCRMR/general-rules/Prescribed-punctuation).)

>Example:  
><CITE>London: : Printed for A. Millar, over-against Catharine-street in the Strand., M,DCC,LI. [1751]</CITE>

### 0.5.37 Line endings

<a name="0.5.37.1">0.5.37.1</a> Omit hyphens or other marks of punctuation used to connect a single word divided between two lines or two portions of a line; transcribe as a single word, ignoring the punctuation. If the function of the hyphen is in doubt (e.g., if it might form part of a compound word), transcribe it.

>Example:  
><CITE>I discorsi di Nicolo Machiauelli, sopra la prima deca di Tito Liuio</CITE>

## 0.5.4 Spacing

### 0.5.42 Spacing within words and numbers

<a name="0.5.42.1">0.5.42.1</a> In general, follow modern spacing conventions when transcribing from the source. Make no attempt to preserve full or irregular spaces between letters within words. 

>Example:  
><CITE>Graecae grammatices</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*: G R AE C AE GRAMMATICES)

>Example:
><CITE>Leo Belgicus</CITE>
>(*Source of information reads*: LE O BELGICV S)

<a name="0.5.42.2">0.5.42.2</a> If a word is divided between the end of one line and the beginning of the next, transcribe it as a single word, ignoring the line-break.

>Example:  
><CITE>De laudibus urbis Etruriae et Italiae</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads (showing line endings)*:  
DE LAVDI  
BVS VRBIS ETRVRIAE  
ET ITALIAE) 

>Example:  
><CITE>Catalogus vniuersalis pro nundinis Francofurtensibus vernalibus de anno ... </CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads (showing line endings)*:  
>CATALOGVS VNI-  
>VERSALIS PRO NVN -  
>DINIS FRANCOFVRTENSI-  
>bus vernalibus de anno …)

<a name="0.5.42.3">0.5.42.3</a> Omit internal spaces when transcribing numbers (including roman numerals).

>(*Source of information reads*: 1/12 000)

### 0.5.43 Spacing between words

<a name="0.5.43.1">0.5.43.1</a> If spacing between words in the source is ambiguous, or lacking, include spaces in the transcription to separate the words as needed.

>Example:  
><CITE>Founding fathers folly day</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*: Foundingfathersfollyday)

>Example:

>(*Source of information reads*: LAMORTE D'ORFEO)

<a name="0.5.43.2">0.5.43.2</a> If the missing spaces occur in the first five words of the title proper (the first six words if the title begins with an article), record a [Variant title](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title) for the form of title as it appears in the source, without the spaces (see [1.6.X.X](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title/#1.6.X.X)).

### 0.5.44 Variant spellings

<a name="0.5.44.1">0.5.44.1</a> Do not insert or delete spaces within or between words that merely represent variant or archaic spellings.

>Example:

<a name="0.5.44.2">0.5.44.2</a> If the variant or archaic spellings occur in the first five words of the title proper (the first six words if the title begins with an article), record a [Variant title](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title) for the form of the title with the spacing inserted (see [1.6.X.X](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title/#1.6.X.X)).

### 0.5.45 Initials, etc.

<a name="0.5.45.1">0.5.45.1</a> Transcribe letters, initials, initialisms, and acronyms without internal spaces, regardless of how they appear in the source.

>Example:  
><CITE>KL Ianuarius habet dies xxxi</CITE>

>Example:  
><CITE>Music sellers to HRH the Prince of Wales</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*: Published by Monzani & Hill Music sellers to HRH the Prince of Wales)

## 0.5.5 Omissions

### 0.5.51 Omissions: general rule

<a name="0.5.51.1">0.5.51.1</a> Indicate omissions in a quoted note or transcribed element by using the mark of omission. When using the mark of omission, generally give it with a space on either side. 

>Example:  
><CITE>Printed by Leon. Lichfield ... and are to be sold by the Widow Howell</CITE>

>Example:  
><CITE>Printed for John Melish, John Vallance, and H.S. Tanner ... by G. Palmer</CITE>

<a name="0.5.51.2">0.5.51.2</a> However, give a space on only one side of the mark of omission if it is preceded by an opening parenthesis or opening square bracket; is followed by a closing parenthesis, closing square bracket, or comma; or, if using ISBD punctuation, comes at the end of an element.

>Example:  
><CITE>Printed for the Widow Swart ..., 1688</CITE>  
>(*Comment*: The mark of omission has a space on only one side because it is at the end of an element.)

>Example:  
><CITE>Se vend chez Audran aux Deux Piliers d'Or rue St. Jacques ..., [late 17th century]</CITE>
>(*Comment*: The mark of omission has a space on only one side because it is at the end of an element.)

<a name="0.5.51.3">0.5.51.3</a> *Exception*. Some element  specify to indicate certain omissions by concisely summarizing the text omitted (in square brackets).  In such cases, do not record the mark of omission (for example, see [Name of publisher](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-publisher/), [4.203.7.2](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-publisher/#4.203.7.2)).

>Example:  
><CITE>Printed for J. Round, R Gosling, T. Woodward [and 9 others]</CITE>

### 0.5.52 Information not considered part of any transcribed element

<a name="0.5.52.1">0.5.52.1</a> Omit, without using the mark of omission, grammatically separable information not considered part of any transcribed element. Such information may include quotations, epigrams, mottoes, advertisements, etc. 

If considered important, give the omitted information in a note.

<a name="5.5.52.2">0.5.52.2</a> If such information is grammatically inseparable from a transcribed element, however, transcribe it as part of that element (see [Grammatical inseparability](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0592-grammatical-inseparability), [0.5.92.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.92.1)).

For Dedications, see X.X.X.X. 

**ALT note: where did dedications go? A search in the Drive folder for DCRM(B) Re-write doesn't get anything. in the RBMS PS, this said to look at 2.3.4.1, under Other Title Information**.

**If dedications are no longer in Other title information (which it doesn't seem to be in the drafts), I propose either omitting it or the following, noting that it doesn't cleanly divide into Books - Not Books)**

<a name="0.5.52.3">0.5.52.3</a> **Dedications**.

Treat the dedication as information not considered part of any element  
<u>if</u>  
the entire resource is the preferred source of information (for example, maps, still images, globes)  
<u>and</u>  
the dedication has not been transcribed as a grammatically inseparable part of another element  
<u>or</u>  
the dedication is not visually connected to information transcribed as part of the title.

Record a grammatically separable dedication that has been omitted from a transcribed element in a note.

Treat the dedication as [Other title information](/DCRMR/title/Other-title-information/) (see [1.23.X.X](/DCRMR/title/Other-title-information/#1.23.X.X))  
<u>if</u>  
the entire resource is not the preferred source of information (for example, the resource has a title page)  
<u>and</u>  
the preferred source of information includes a dedication that has not already been transcribed as a grammatically inseparable part of another element.

Treat the dedication as [Other title information](/DCRMR/title/Other-title-information/) (see [1.23.X.X](/DCRMR/title/Other-title-information/#1.23.X.X))  
<u>if</u>  
the dedication has not already been transcribed as a grammatically inseparable part of another element  
<u>and</u>  
the dedication is visually connected to information transcribed as part of the title.

If treating the dedication as [Other title information](DCRMR/title/Other-title-information/) and any part of the dedication is omitted, use the mark of omission.

### 0.5.53 Information not taken from the preferred source of information

<a name="0.5.53.1">0.5.53.1</a> If information is transcribed from a source other than the preferred source of information and the transcribed information is preceded or followed by grammatically separable information that is not considered part of the element, then omit the words that precede or follow. Do not use the mark of omission.

If considered important, give the omitted text in a note.

>Example:  
>Designation of edition: <CITE>The second edition</CITE>  
>Note on edition statement: <CITE>Edition statement from colophon; full colophon reads: This, the second edition of Le morte Darthur, with Aubrey Beardsley’s designs ... is limited to 1000 copies for the United Kingdom and 500 for America, after printing which the type has been distributed.</CITE>

>Example:  
>Place of publication: <CITE>Impressum Lypczk</CITE>  
>Name of publisher: <CITE>per Arnoldum de Colonia, Anno nonagesimo quinto</CITE>  
>Note on publication statement: <CITE>Imprint from colophon; full colophon reads: Michaelis Scoti de procreat[i]o[n]e et ho[m]i[ni]s phisionomia explicit. Impressum Lypczk per Arnoldum de Colonia Anno nonagesimo quinto.</CITE>

## 0.5.6 Interpolations

### 0.5.61 Interpolations: general rule

<a name="0.5.61.1">0.5.61.1</a> Indicate an interpolation in a transcribed element or in a quoted note by enclosing it in square brackets. If transcribing text with missing or obscured letters or words that can be reconstructed with some certainty, include these in the transcription, enclosing them in square brackets.

Make an explanatory note if considered important for identification.

For guidance on expanding brevigraphs (special marks of contraction in continuance of the manuscript tradition), see [0.5.16.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.16.1).

>Example:
><CITE>Multo[rum]</CITE>  
>(*Comment*: The word ends with a ![&lsqb;rum&rsqb;](https://rbms-bsc.github.io/DCRMR/assets/pictures/transcription/[rum]-1.png) symbol.)

>Example:  
><CITE>[Englan]ds improvement, and seasonable advice to all gentlemen and farmers</CITE>  
>(*Comment*: Mutilated title page affecting first word of title; full title from Wing; the formal citation for Wing is given in a [Manifestation described in](/DCRMR/other-notes/Manifestation-described-in) note (see [7.223.4.1](/DCRMR/other-notes/Manifestation-described-in/#7.223.4.1)).

>Example:  
><CITE>Spectrographie des rayons [gamma] par diffraction cristalline</CITE>  
>(*Comment*: The Greek symbol for "gamma" is used in the title)

>Example:  
><CITE>Repertorium nouu[m] cum additionibus ad omnia opera Felini Sandei Farrariensis</CITE>  
>(*Comment*: "Nouum" on title page spelled with symbol similar to cursive "z")


### 0.5.62 Conjectural and indecipherable text

<a name="0.5.62.1">0.5.62.1</a> Indicate a conjectural interpolation by adding a question mark immediately after the interpolation, within the square brackets. Supply a question mark enclosed in square brackets for each indeterminable word or portion of word.

Make a note to justify the interpolations, provide explanations, or offer tentative readings of indecipherable portions of text, if considered important.

>Example:  
><CITE>Amico[rum?]</CITE>  
>(*Comment*: The word ends with a symbol of contraction that is conjectured to be a ![&#42845;](https://rbms-bsc.github.io/DCRMR/assets/pictures/transcription/[rum]-1.png).)

>Example:  
><CITE>Mr. [--ch?], Cornhill</CITE>  
>(*Comment*: Indecipherable signature above title on cover transcribed in a local note.)

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>Ft. Monroe [Gunnery?]</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>Last word of the title is illegible, the conjecture is based on image content.</CITE>

### 0.5.63 Lacunae in imperfect copies 

<a name="0.5.63.1">0.5.63.1</a> If the description is based on an imperfect copy and the omission cannot be conjectured, then use the mark of omission enclosed in square brackets ([...]) to show lacunae in the resource.

>Example:  
>Place of publication: <CITE>En Barcelona</CITE>  
>Name of publisher: <CITE>Por Sebastian Mateu[...]</CITE>  
>Note on publication statement: <CITE>Description based on an imperfect copy; title page torn with partial loss of imprint.</CITE>

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>[...] modern minstrels</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>Description based on an imperfect example; title torn, removing all lettering above lower portion of "modern".</CITE>  

### 0.5.64 Blank spaces intended for completion

<a name="0.5.64.1">0.5.64.1</a> If transcribing text containing a blank space intended to be completed after the resource is issued, supply the word “blank” enclosed in square brackets. Make an explanatory note.

<a name="0.5.64.2">0.5.64.2</a> If the blank has been completed in the item being described, indicate this in a [Note on item](/DCRMR/notes-on-items/Note-on-item), if considered important (see [8.20.X.X](/DCRMR/notes-on-items/Note-on-item/#8.20.X.X)).

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>A catalogue of books, to be sold on [blank] the [blank] day of February, 1755 ...</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>Spaces in the title for the exact day and date of the auction left blank by printer.</CITE>  
>Note on item (optional): <CITE>Library's copy has date of auction supplied in manuscript: [Wednesday] the [26th] day of February, 1755.</CITE>

>Example:
>Statement of responsibility: <CITE>drawn by [blank]</CITE>  
>Note on statement of responsibility: <CITE>Space for the name of the student left blank by printer.</CITE>  
>Note on item (optional): <CITE>Library's copy has blanks supplied in manuscript: State of [New York] / drawn by [Fannie Ufford]</CITE>  

<a name="0.5.64.3">0.5.64.3</a> If the blank occurs in the first five words of the title proper (the first six words if the title begins with an article), record a [Variant title](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title) for the form of title without the interpolated word “[blank]” (see [1.6.X.X](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title/#1.6.X.X)).

### 0.5.65 Blank spaces for initial letters

<a name="0.5.65.1">0.5.65.1</a> If a space for an initial letter has been left blank, supply the intended letter in square brackets, regardless of whether the letter has been executed in manuscript.

Make an explanatory note.

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>[M]issae familiares</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>Space for initial letter of first word of title left blank by printer.</CITE>  
>Note on item (optional): <CITE>Library's copy: Initial letter executed in red and blue ink.</CITE>

<a name="0.5.65.2">0.5.65.2</a> If a guide letter has been printed, transcribe it without square brackets. In case of doubt about whether a printed guide letter is present, transcribe the letter without square brackets.

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>Historiarum libri XXXV</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>Space for initial letter of first word of title left blank by printer.</CITE>  
>Note on item (optional): <CITE>LC copy: Printed guide letter "H" at beginning of title not executed in manuscript.</CITE>

<a name="0.5.65.3">0.5.65.3</a> Make a [Note on item](/DCRMR/notes-on-items/Note-on-item) to indicate the presence or absence of manuscript execution in the copy, if considered important (see [8.20.X.X](/DCRMR/notes-on-items/Note-on-item/#8.20.X.X)).
				
## 0.5.7 Inaccuracies, misprints, etc.

### 0.5.72 Misprints and unintentional inaccuracies

<a name="0.5.72.1">0.5.72.1</a> Transcribe misprints or unintentional misspellings as they appear on the source. Follow such an inaccuracy either by “[sic]” or by “that is” and the correction within square brackets.

>Example:  
><CITE>Of the knowledeg [sic] whiche maketh a wise man</CITE>

>Example:  
><CITE>Constitutionalsit [sic]--Extra</CITE>

>Example:  
><CITE>Archivum Eurasiae medii aeivi [that is, aevi]</CITE>

>Example:  
><CITE>The notted [that is, noted] history of Mother Grim</CITE>

<a name="0.5.72.2">0.5.72.2</a> If the misprint or misspelling occurs in the first five words of the title proper (the first six words if the title begins with an article), record [Variant titles](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title) for the form of title without the interpolation and for the form of title as if it had been printed or written correctly (see [1.6.X.X](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title/#1.6.X.X)).

<a name="0.5.72.3">0.5.72.3</a> Do not correct words spelled according to older or non-standard orthographic conventions (“françoise” for “française,” or “antient” for “ancient”).

<a name="0.5.72.4">0.5.72.4</a> *Optionally*, transcribe the text as it appears on the source without the interpolation. Make a note correcting the misprint or misspelling.

If the misprint or misspelling occurs in the first five words of the title proper (the first six words if the title begins with an article), record a [Variant title](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title) for the form of title as if it had been printed or written correctly (see [1.6.X.X](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title/#1.6.X.X)).

### 0.5.73 Deliberate misspellings

<a name="0.5.73.1">0.5.73.1</a> Do not correct deliberately misspelled words. If considered important, make an explanatory note.

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>The Summer Shower, or, Mademoiselle Par, a Pluye</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>For "Par, a Pluye" read "parapluie".</CITE>

If considered important, record a [Variant title](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title) (see [1.6.X.X](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title/#1.6.X.X)).

### 0.5.74 Turned and approximated letters

<a name="0.5.74.1">0.5.74.1</a> Transcribe a turned character, whether inadvertent or deliberate, as the intended character. Make an explanatory note if considered important for identification.

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>Queen</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>The "u" in "Queen" in the title is turned.</CITE>

<a name="0.5.74.2">0.5.74.2</a> Transcribe characters used to approximate a different character (e.g., when VV and vv letterforms have been used to represent the single letter W or w) as the intended character. 

Make an explanatory note if considered important for identification.

| Forms of W|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Source** | **Transcription** | **Example** | **Transcription of example** |
| ![V V](https://rbms-bsc.github.io/DCRMR/assets/pictures/transcription/forms_w_V_V.png) | w | ![vvhole](https://rbms-bsc.github.io/DCRMR/assets/pictures/transcription/forms_w_VVhole.png) | vvhole |

<a name="0.5.74.3">0.5.74.3</a> If the characters used to approximate a different character occur in the first five words of the title proper (the first six words if the title begins with an article), record a [Variant title](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title) for the form of title with the characters transcribed if considered important (see [1.6.X.X](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title/#1.6.X.X)).

## 0.5.8 Other transcription rules

### 0.5.82 Abbreviations and contractions

For punctuation indicating an abbreviation, see [Punctuation indicating an abbreviation](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#05385-punctuation-indicating-an-abbreviation) ([0.5.385.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.385.1)).

<a name="0.5.82.1">0.5.82.1</a> When transcribing, do not abbreviate any words not abbreviated in the source.

<a name="0.5.82.2">0.5.82.2</a> If brevigraphs (special marks of contraction in continuance of the manuscript tradition) have been used, expand affected words to their full form and enclose supplied letters in square brackets (see [0.5.16.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.16.1)). Make an explanatory note if considered important. If a brevigraph standing for an entire word appears in the source, supply instead the word itself, enclosed in square brackets. However, transcribe an ampersand or a Tironian sign (&#8266;) as an ampersand. Enclose each expansion or supplied word in its own set of square brackets.

>Example:  
><CITE>Henricus Dei gra[tia] Rex Anglie</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*: HENRICVS DEI GRĀ REX ANGLIE)

<a name="0.5.82.3">0.5.82.3</a> If the meaning of a brevigraph is conjectural or unknown, apply the bracketing
conventions given in [Conjectural or indecipherable text](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0562-conjectural-and-indecipherable-text) (see [0.5.62.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.62.1)).

<a name="0.5.82.4">0.5.82.4</a> Do not expand abbreviations or modern contractions when transcribing. If the abbreviation occurs in the first five words of the title proper, record a [Variant title](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title) if considered important (see [1.6.X.X](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title/#1.6.X.X)).  


### 0.5.84 Letters or words intended to be read more than once

**ALT note: The text of the main instruction comes pre-3R RDA; I think we'll want to modify it because copyright. Post-3R RDA states: Condition: A letter or word appears only once but is intended to be read more than once. Option: Repeat the letter or word**.

<a name="0.5.84.1">0.5.84.1</a> If a letter or word appears only once but the design of the source of information makes it clear that it is intended to be read more than once, repeat the letter or word.

**ALT note: End of pre-3R RDA text**

Make an explanatory note.

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>Here comes Santa Claus</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>Title words alternate vertically and horizontally, intersecting with shared letters, as in a crossword puzzle.</CITE>

### 0.5.86 Superscripts and subscripts

<a name="0.5.86.1">0.5.86.1</a> Transcribe superscript and subscript characters on the line unless the sense would be affected (e.g., in a mathematical formula). Always transcribe a period in an abbreviation at the end of the abbrevation.

>Example:  
><CITE>Mr. Jas. McAdam</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*: M.<sup>r</sup> J.<sup>as</sup> M<sup>c</sup>Adam)

>Example:  
><CITE>M. Vdr. Gucht sculp.</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*: M. V.<sup>dr</sup> Gucht Sculp.)

>Example:  
><CITE>Caroe. Watson</CITE>  
>(*Source of information reads*: Caro.<sup>e</sup> Watson)  
>(*Comment*: Engraver is Caroline Watson)

### 0.5.88 Numbers expressed as numerals or words

**ALT note: in the latter part of this section, we didn't deviate from pre-3R RDA. Post-3R RDA is less than helpful in [Guidelines on normalized transcription / Numbers](https://beta.rdatoolkit.org/en-US_ala-914685cb-0fa2-394d-a0a2-16e537eb586a/p_mvj_cgs_b2b), giving options for "Transcribe a numeral as it appears", "Transcribe a numeral in a form preferred by an agent who creates the metadata unless the form is unclear", and "Transcribe a numeral as it appears and in an equivalent form preferred ...". The guidance for ordinals isn't a bad, but it's still all just options (at least there's only one)**.

<a name="0.5.88.1">0.5.88.1</a> When recording numbers expressed as numerals or as words in a transcribed element, transcribe them in the form in which they appear on the source of information. Apply the general guidelines on transcription as applicable.

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>Fifty two sermons for every Sunday of the year MDCCXXVII</CITE>

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>LI sermons</CITE>

>Example:  
>Other title information: <CITE>a cookery book calendar for 1931 : containing fifty-two recipes</CITE>

<a name="0.5.88.2">0.5.88.2</a> 
**ALT note: do we still need this enumeration? I spot-checked a few of these elements, and the instruction seems to be within the element instruction itself. Note that I haven't updated the element names or hyperlinked, since I don't know if we want to keep the list**.
Also transcribe numbers expressed as numerals or as words in the form in which they appear on the source of information in the following elements:
* Numeric and/or alphabetic designation of first issue or part of sequence
* Chronological designation of first issue or part of sequence
* Numeric and/or alphabetic designation of last issue or part of sequence
* Chronological designation of last issue or part of sequence
* Alternative numeric and/or alphabetic designation of first issue or part of sequence
* Alternative chronological designation of first issue or part of sequence
* Alternative numeric and/or alphabetic designation of last issue or part of sequence
* Alternative chronological designation of last issue or part of sequence
* Date of production
* Date of publication
* Date of distribution
* Date of manufacture
* Numbering within series
* Numbering within subseries

<a name="0.5.88.3">0.5.88.3</a> *Optionally*, for dates of publication, distribution, and manufacture add the equivalent numerals in the form preferred by the agency creating the data, if considered important for identification. Indicate that the information was taken from a source outside the resource itself (see [Interpolations](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#056-interpolations), [0.5.61.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.5.61.1)). 

<a name="0.5.88.4">0.5.88.4</a> When recording numbers expressed as numerals or words in all other non-transcribed elements, apply the following guidelines:

**ALT note: the following text is straight from pre-3R RDA**.

<u>1.8.2 Form of Numerals</u>

Record numerals in the form preferred by the agency creating the data, unless the substitution would make the numbering less clear.

>Example: [RDA]  
><CITE>tome 3</CITE>  
>Numbering within series on source of information reads: tome III

Alternatives
Record numerals in the form in which they appear on the source of information.

>Example: [RDA]  
><CITE>tome III</CITE>
>Numbering within series

[Alternative]

Record the numerals in the form in which they appear on the source. Add the equivalent numerals in the form preferred by the agency creating the data. Indicate that the information was taken from a source outside the resource itself (see 2.2.4).

>Example: [RDA]  
><CITE>tome III [3]</CITE>  
>Numbering within series on source of information reads: tome III

<u>1.8.3 Numbers Expressed as Words</u>

Substitute numerals for numbers expressed as words.

<u>1.8.4 Inclusive Numbers</u>

When recording inclusive dates and other inclusive numbers, record both the first and last number in full.

>Example: [RDA]  
><CITE>1967–1972</CITE>
>Source of information reads: 1967–72

<u>1.8.5 Ordinal Numbers</u>

When recording ordinal numbers (expressed either as numerals or as words), record them as numerals and indicate that they are ordinal numbers following standard usage for the language:

English language source. 
When recording ordinal numbers from an English-language source, record them as numerals in the form 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.

Chinese, Japanese, or Korean language source. 
When recording ordinal numerals from a source in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean, record them as numerals accompanied by the character indicating that the numeral is ordinal.

>Example: [RDA]  
><CITE>第8</CITE>  
>8th in Chinese

Source in a language other than English, Chinese, Japanese, or Korean. 
When recording ordinal numerals from a source in another language, record them as numerals and indicate that they are ordinal numbers following the usage of the language, if ascertainable.

>French

>Example: [RDA]  
><CITE>1., 2., 3., etc.</CITE>  
>German

>Example: [RDA]
><CITE>1o, 1a, 2o, 2a, 3o, 3a, etc.</CITE>
>Italian

If the usage of a language cannot be ascertained, use the form 1., 2., 3., etc.

## 0.5.9 Intra- and inter-element rules

### 0.5.92 Grammatical inseparability

<a name="0.5.92.1">0.5.92.1</a> Do not omit or transpose grammatically inseparable text, regardless of whether it contains information belonging to other data elements. Consider text to be grammatically inseparable if it is connected by case ending, or its transposition or omission would disturb the grammatical construction of information.

>Example:  
><CITE>The posthumous works of Robert Hooke</CITE>

>Example:  
><CITE>Monsieur Bossu's treatise of the epick poem</CITE>

>Example:  
><CITE>M. Tullii Ciceronis de officiis libri tres</CITE>

>Example:  
><CITE>Brown's industrial gazetteer and hand-book of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R.R.</CITE>

>Example:  
><CITE>Number ... of A picture of the times, to be continued weekly, in a series of letters, addressed to the people of England</CITE>

>Example:  
><CITE>drawn, engraved & published by W. Birch, Springland near Bristol, Pennsylva.d</CITE>  
>(*Comment*: “& published” is grammatically inseparable. The phrase is transcribed in a [Statement of responsibility](/DCRMR/sor/Statement-of-responsibility/).)

<a name="0.5.92.2">0.5.92.2</a> **Still images**. Consider layout, color, size, and other graphic factors to determine whether text is visually inseparable.

>Example:  
><CITE>Portrait of an Irish chief, drawn from life at Wexford</CITE>  
>(*Comment*: Size and location of lettering on material visually indicate that “drawn from life at Wexford” is part of a satiric title and not a statement of responsibility.)

### 0.5.94 Order and transposition

**ALT note: What do we do with order and transposition in an atomized, element-based environment? How do we frame this? I kept it as-is from the RBMS PS for now. I didn't do all of the numbering because I think we may end up re-working this section**.

<a name="0.5.94.1">0.5.94.1</a> Follow the conventions appropriate to the script of the material when determining the order in which to transcribe information. For materials in roman script, this will generally mean proceeding from left to right and from top to bottom when transcribing information. 

If information appears in the source in a different order than that specified by ISBD presentation, transpose the information to its appropriate data element unless: 
case endings would be affected, 
<u>or</u>
the grammatical construction of the information would be disturbed, 
<u>or</u>
the text is otherwise grammatically inseparable from its surrounding elements, 
<u>or</u> 
the data element  specify otherwise (see RBMS PS 2.3.4 and 2.4.1.6). 

Similarly, if the order of information in the source would result in a transcription that is confusing, awkward, or nonsensical, transpose the information as needed into the data element that makes the most sense. This will typically apply when particular elements of text have been distinguished in the source by their size, typography, or style of letterforms in order to imply an obvious natural reading order. 

Do not use the mark of omission to indicate transposition. 

Make a note to indicate the order in which the transposed information appears in the source.

**ALT note: Title proper, Other title information, and Statement of Responsibility don't have a handy super-element like Publication statement. Currently, I have the examples in this section as the ISBD formatted, like you'd see in a 245, followed by the example atomized into elements. Elizabeth noted that this makes it look like we're asking catalogers to repeat information. I'm happy to delete the atomized version, but I wanted to leave it in for now as a point of discussion**.

>Example: 
><CITE>Symphony no. 6 : Pastoral / by Ludwig van Beethoven.</CITE>  
>Title proper: <CITE>Symphony no. 6</CITE>  
>Other title information: <CITE>Pastoral</CITE>  
>Statement of responsibility: <CITE>by Ludwig van Beethoven</CITE>  
>Note on statement of responsibility: <CITE>Composer’s name appears between the title and other title information on the title page.</CITE>

>Example:  
><CITE>The coast of the United States of North America : from New York to St. Augustine / drawn and regulated according the latest surveys and astronomical observations by Edmund Blunt ; D.R. Harrison, sc.</CITE>  
>Title proper: <CITE>The coast of the United States of North America</CITE>  
>Other title information: <CITE>from New York to St. Augustine</CITE>  
>Statement of responsibility: <CITE>drawn and regulated according the latest surveys and astronomical observations by Edmund Blunt ; D.R. Harrison, sc.</CITE>  
>Note on statement of responsibility: <CITE>Engraver statement appears at head of title, on the top right corner of the sheet.</CITE>

<u>If</u>  
information appears in scattered form on the preferred source of information but no transposition is needed  
<u>and</u>  
information about the specific placement of the scattered information is considered important for identification  
<u>then</u>  
make a note to indicate the placement.

>Example:  
><CITE>The country twenty five miles round New York / drawn by a gentleman from that city ; J. Barber, sculp., Holborn Hill.</CITE>  
>Title proper: <CITE>The country twenty five miles round New York</CITE>  
>Statement of responsibility: <CITE>drawn by a gentleman from that city ; J. Barber, sculp., Holborn Hill.</CITE>  
>Note on statement of responsibility: <CITE>Engraver statement appears in bottom right corner of map.</CITE>

If the sequence and layout of the information in the source are ambiguous or otherwise insufficient to determine the order, transcribe the information in the order that makes the most sense. Make a note to indicate the ambiguity of the order in the source, if considered important for identification or selection.
