<a name="5.34.34.5">5.34.34.5</a> If the manifestation is issued in more than one physical part and the name or form of [Name of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/) changes in the course of publication, always transcribe the manufacture information on the first or earliest part as the [Manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Manufacture-statement/) and give the manufacture information of the later part(s) in a note on manufacture statement (see [Name of manufacturer, 5.32.35.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/#5.32.35.1)).

<a name="5.34.34.6">5.34.34.6</a> Always make a note on manufacture statement if no name, address, or device of a manufacturer appears on the manifestation or if the responsibility of a manufacturer for a particular manifestation is conjectured. In any case of a supplied manufacturer, give supporting evidence in a note on manufacture statement (see [Name of manufacturer, 5.32.36.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/#5.32.36.1)).

<a name="5.34.36.3">5.34.36.3</a> Always make a note on manufacture statement if the [Date of manufacture](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-manufacture/) is known to be fictitious or incorrect by supplying the actual date (see [5.33.352.4](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-manufacture/#5.33.352.4)).

<a name="5.34.36.4">5.34.36.4</a> When following the option in [5.33.352.4](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-manufacture/#5.33.352.4), always make a note on manufacture statement to indicate the source of the information if the reason for supplying the actual date is not apparent from the rest of the description (see [Date of manufacture, 5.33.352.4](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-manufacture/#5.33.352.4)).

<a name="5.34.36.5">5.34.36.5</a> Always make a note on manufacture statement indicating the basis for the supplied year if the year of manufacture is based on the Julian calendar (sometimes called the Old Style calendar) and the manifestation is known to have been manufactured in the following year according to the Gregorian calendar (see [Date of manufacture, 5.33.352.5](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-manufacture/#5.33.352.5)).

<a name="5.34.36.6">5.34.36.6</a> If the [Date of manufacture](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-manufacture/) requires more than a single adjustment or addition, make a note on manufacture statement on the source of supplied dates (see [5.33.352.7](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-manufacture/#5.33.352.7)).

<a name="5.34.36.73">5.34.36.73</a> When supplying a conjectural [Date of manufacture](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-manufacture/) based on any information available, always indicate the basis for the conjecture in a note on manufacture statement (see [5.33.354.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-manufacture/#5.33.354.1)).

<a name="5.34.36.75">5.34.36.75</a> When supplying a probable date or period of manufacture according to one of the patterns shown in  [5.33.3545.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-manufacture/#5.33.3545.1), indicate the basis for the conjecture in a note on manufacture statement (see [Date of manufacture, 5.33.3545.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-manufacture/#5.33.3545.1)).

<a name="5.34.36.8">5.34.36.8</a> Record the date of each volume in a note on manufacture statement if considered important. Such a note on manufacture statement is particularly useful when the order of manufacture does not correspond to the order of the volume numeration (see [Date of manufacture, 5.33.355.2](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-manufacture/#5.33.355.2)).

<a name="5.34.36.9">5.34.36.9</a> If parts of a manifestation have individual title pages bearing dates that differ from the date pertaining to the whole manifestation, always give these additional dates in a note on manufacture statement (see [Date of manufacture, 5.33.356.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-manufacture/#5.33.356.1)).

>Example:  
><CITe>This is ostensibly an English printing as the manifestation contains press figures, which is an English trait, and its signatures are centred in the direction line. It is an almost identical copy of the seventh London edition, dated 1779, the main differences being there are no catchwords and the use of French ornaments. It is likely a piracy, printed by an English printer employed by Besongne in Rouen</CITE>  
>(*Comment*: The imprint reads “Rouen, printed for JJ. Besongne, book-seller, in Grosse Horloge's street, M.DCC.LXXXI")
