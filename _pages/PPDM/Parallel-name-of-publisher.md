## 5.225.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="5.225.2.1">5.225.2.1</a> A nomen that is a name of publisher in another language or script.

## 5.225.31 Publisher names in more than one language or script

<a name="5.225.31.1">5.225.31.1</a> Take parallel publishers’ names from the same source as the [Name of publisher](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-publisher). Make a [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement) on parallel publishers’ names found elsewhere if considered important for identification (see [Note on publication statement, 5.24.35A.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#5.24.35A.1)).

<a name="5.225.31.2">5.225.31.2</a> Make a [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement) to indicate the original position on the source of any transposed statements (see [5.24.34.7](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#5.24.34.7)).

<a name="5.225.31.3">5.225.31.3</a> *Optionally*, if the parallel names of publisher are too numerous to record exhaustively and some may be omitted without significant loss of identification then all parallel publishers’ names after the third may be omitted. Supply in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission. Include the number of omitted names (if more than one) in the supplied phrase.
