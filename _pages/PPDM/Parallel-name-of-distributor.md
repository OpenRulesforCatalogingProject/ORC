## 5.275.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="5.275.2.1">5.275.2.1</a> A nomen that is a name of distributor in another language or script.

## 5.275.31 Distributor names in more than one language or script

<a name="5.275.31.1">5.275.31.1</a> Take parallel distributors’ names from the same source as the [Name of distributor](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-distributor/). Make a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) for  parallel distributors’ names found elsewhere if considered important for identification (see [Note on distribution statement, 5.285.35A.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.35A.1)).

<a name="5.275.31.2">5.275.31.2</a> Make a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) to indicate the original position on the source of any transposed statements (see [5.285.34.7](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.34.7)). 

<a name="5.275.31.3">5.275.31.3</a> *Optionally*, if the parallel names of distributor are too numerous to record exhaustively and some may be omitted without significant loss of identification then all parallel distributors’ names after the third may be omitted. Supply in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission. Include the number of omitted names (if more than one) in the supplied phrase.
