## 5.275.1 Element information

<a name="5.275.1.1">5.275.1.1</a> [Link to RDA Toolkit](https://beta.rdatoolkit.org/Content/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-fe253018-c149-3a20-9fdb-c9c17faa0ac0){:target="_blank"}

<a name="5.275.1.2">5.275.1.2</a> [Sources of information](/DCRMR/ppdm/#5011-sources-of-information)

## 5.275.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="5.275.2.1">5.275.2.1</a> A nomen that is a name of distributor in another language or script.

## 5.275.31 Distributor names in more than one language or script

<a name="5.275.31.1">5.275.31.1</a> Take parallel distributors’ names from the same source as the [Name of distributor](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-distributor/). Make a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) for  parallel distributors’ names found elsewhere if considered important (see [Note on distribution statement, 5.285.35.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.35.1)).

<a name="5.275.31.2">5.275.31.2</a> Make a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) to indicate the original position on the source of any transposed statements (see [5.285.34.7](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.34.7)). 

<a name="5.275.31.3">5.275.31.3</a> If the [Name of distributor](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-distributor/) appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the place in the language or script of the [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper) as a [Name of distributor](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-distributor/) element. If this criterion does not apply, transcribe the [Name of distributor](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-distributor/) that appears first.

<a name="5.275.31.4">5.275.31.4</a> Transcribe remaining [Names of distributor](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-distributor/) as parallel names of distributor. If a parallel name of distributor is from a different source than the [Name of distributor](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-distributor/), make a Note on distribution statement if considered important (see [Note on distribution statement, 5.285.35.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.35.1)).

<a name="5.275.31.5">5.275.31.5</a> *Optionally*, if the parallel names of distributor are too numerous to list exhaustively and some may be omitted without significant loss of identification then all parallel distributors’ names after the third may be omitted. In such cases, after the third parallel name of distributor, supply in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission. Include the number of omitted names (if more than one) in the supplied phrase. Do not use a mark of omission.
