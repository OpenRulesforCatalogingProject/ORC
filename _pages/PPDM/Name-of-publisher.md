<a name="4.203.7.2">4.203.7.2</a>  *Optionally,* if it is considered that the names are too numerous to list exhaustively, and that some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, the [publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Publication-statement/) may be shortened by omitting all the names after the third. In such cases, use the mark of omission and supply after it in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission.

## 4.203.9 Supplied and conjectured names of publishers

<a name="4.203.9.1">4.203.9.1</a> If no name, address, or device of a publisher appears on the manifestation, supply the name of the publisher in square brackets if known.

## 4.203.96 Publisher transcribed as part of another element 

<a name="4.203.96.1">4.203.96.1</a> If no formal publisher’s name statement appears on the manifestation, and the name of the publisher has already been transcribed as part of another element, supply it within square brackets.
