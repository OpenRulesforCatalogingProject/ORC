<a name="5.22.34.2">5.22.34.2</a> *Optionally*, if it is considered that the names are too numerous to list exhaustively, and that some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, the [Publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Publication-statement/) may be shortened by omitting all the names after the third. In such cases, use the mark of omission and supply after it in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission.

><CITE>London : Printed for Knight and Lacy, Paternoster-Row ; Greenfield, Mass. : Re-printed by Ansel Phelps, and for sale by him at his bookstore, also by West & Richardson, Cummings, Hilliard & Co., Boston, and Wilder & Campbell, New-York</CITE>

## 5.22.35 Names of publishers in multipart monographs 

<a name="5.22.35.1">5.22.35.1</a> If the manifestation is issued in more than one physical part and the name of publisher or the publisher's form of name changes in the course of publication, transcribe the [Publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Publication-statement/) of the first or earliest part and give the [Publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Publication-statement/) of the later part(s) in a [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/) (see [5.24.33.4](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#5.24.33.4)).

## 5.22.36 Supplied and conjectured names of publishers

<a name="5.22.36.1">5.22.36.1</a> If no name, address, or device of a publisher appears on the manifestation, supply the name of the publisher in square brackets if known. If the responsibility of a publisher for a particular manifestation is conjectured, either add a question mark to any supplied name or give the information in a [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/). In any case of a supplied publisher give supporting evidence in a [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/) (see [5.24.33.5](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#5.24.33.5)).

>Example:  
>Name of publisher: <CITE>[Anton Koberger]</CITE>  
>Note on publication statement: <CITE>Imprint from Goff.</CITE>  
>(*Comment*: The formal citation for Goff is given in a References to published descriptions note)

## 5.22.37 No supplied name of publisher

<a name="5.22.37.1">5.22.37.1</a> If no publisher’s name can be conjectured, record “publisher not identified” in square brackets.

## 5.22.38 Publisher names transcribed as part of another element 

<a name="5.22.38.1">5.22.38.1</a> If the name of the publisher does not appear in the [Publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Publication-statement/), but has already been transcribed as part of another element, supply it within square brackets.

>Example:  
>Name of publisher: <CITE>[Pour Symo[n] Vostre Libraire par Philippe Pigouchet]</CITE>  
>(*Comment*: Title reads “Ces presentes heures a lusaige de Ro[m]me : so[n]t au lo[n]g sa[n]s req[ue]rir [et] ont este faictes pour Symo[n] Vostre Libraire: demourent a Paris a la rue neuue nostre dame, a lenseigne Sainct Iehan leuangeliste par Philippe Pigouchet.”)

If transcribing a publisher name as part of another element, do not abridge or expand the name of publisher simply because it repeats or omits information given elsewhere in the description.

## 5.22.39 Publisher names in more than one language or script

<a name="5.22.39.1">5.22.39.1</a> If the name of the publisher appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the name in the language or script of the [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/), or if this criterion does not apply, transcribe the name that appears first. Transcribe the remaining statements(s) as parallel statements (see [Parallel name of publisher](/DCRMR/ppdm/Parallel-name-of-publisher/)).  Make a [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/) to indicate the original position on the source of any transposed statements (see [ 5.24.34.2](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/# 5.24.34.2)).
