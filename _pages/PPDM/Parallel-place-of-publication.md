<a name="5.215.1.1">5.215.1.1</a> [Link to RDA Toolkit](https://beta.rdatoolkit.org/Content/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-5e38f1d4-17a1-3ff9-a1c8-eacbfd04e68e){:target="_blank"}

## 5.215.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="5.215.2.1">5.215.2.1</a> A place of publication in another language or script.

## 5.215.31 Publication place names in more than one language or script

<a name="5.215.31.1">5.215.31.1</a> Take parallel places of publication from the same source as the [Place of publication](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-publication/). Make a [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/) on parallel places of publication found elsewhere if considered important for identification (see [5.24.33.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#5.24.33.1)).

<a name="5.215.31.2">5.215.31.2</a> Make a [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/) to indicate the original position of the source of any transposed statements (see [5.24.32.7](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#5.24.32.7)).

<a name="5.215.31.3">5.215.31.3</a> If the [Place of publication](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-publication/) appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the place in the language or script of the [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/) as a [Place of publication](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-publication/) element.  If this criterion does not apply, transcribe the [Place of publication](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-publication/) that appears first.

<a name="5.215.31.4">5.215.31.4</a> Transcribe remaining [Places of publication](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-publication/) as parallel places of publication.  If a parallel place of publication is from a different source than the [Place of publication](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-publication/), make a [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/) if considered important for identification (see [Note on publication statement, 5.24.33.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#5.24.33.1)).

<a name="5.215.31.5">5.215.31.5</a> *Optionally*, if the parallel places of publication are too numerous to record exhaustively and some may be omitted without significant loss of identification then all parallel places of publication after the third may be omitted. Supply in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission. Include the number of omitted places (if more than one) in the supplied phrase.
