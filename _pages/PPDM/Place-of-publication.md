## 5.21.33 Two or more places of publication

<a name="5.21.33.1">5.21.33.1</a> If the manifestation shows two or more places of publication, and all are related to the same publisher, transcribe all in the order in which they appear.

>Example:

<a name="5.21.33.2">5.21.33.2</a> *Optionally*, if it is considered that the places are too numerous to list exhaustively, and that some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, the place of publication may be shortened by omitting all the places after the third. In such cases, after the third place, supply in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission. Include the number of omitted places (if more than one) in the supplied phrase. Do not use a mark of omission.

>(*Comment*: Example formatted with ISBD punctuation for clarity)

<a name="5.21.33.4">5.21.33.4</a> Do not, however, transcribe a subsequent place as a place of publication if it must be recorded as a grammatically inseparable part of another element.

>Example:  
>Place of publication: <CITE>London</CITE>  
>Name of publisher: <CITE>Printed and published by J. P. Coghlan, and sold by J. Wilkie, and C. Elliot, Edinburgh</CITE>  

<a name="5.21.33.5">5.21.33.5</a> If a place of publication associated with an earlier manifestation appears together with the actual place of publication of the manifestation being described, transcribe the places as a single element in the order in which they appear.

>Example:  
><CITE>Philadelphia printed, London reprinted</CITE>

<a name="5.21.33.6">5.21.33.6</a> If both the place and [Name of publisher](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-publisher/) associated with an earlier manifestation appear together with the place and [Name of publisher](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-publisher/) of the manifestation being described, transcribe each place with the publisher to which it corresponds.

<a name="5.21.34.1">5.21.34.1</a> If the manifestation is issued in more than one physical part, and the place of publication changes in the course of publication, always give the place of publication of the later part(s) in a [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/) (see [5.24.32.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#5.24.32.1)).

>Example:

>Note on publication statement: <CITE>Place of publication in v. 33-40: Stuttgart ; Augsburg</CITE>  
>(*Comment*: Example formatted with ISBD punctuation for clarity)

## 5.21.35 Place names that are grammatically inseparable parts of other elements

<a name="5.21.35.1">5.21.35.1</a> If the place of publication appears only as a grammatically inseparable part of another element and is transcribed there, supply the place of publication in square brackets (see [5.2.34.3](/DCRMR/ppdm/Publication-statement/#5.2.34.3)).
