>Example:  
><CITE>A Lausanne & se trouve à Paris</CITE>

<a name="4.201.8.2">4.201.8.2</a> *Optionally*, if it is considered that the places are too numerous to list exhaustively, and that some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, the place of publication may be shortened by omitting all the places after the third. In such cases, use the mark of omission and supply after it in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission. Include the number of omitted places (if more than one) in the supplied phrase.

>Example:  
><CITE>London ; Reading ; Bath ... [and 6 other cities in England]</CITE>

<a name="4.201.8.3">4.201.8.3</a> If a subsequent place of publication is not related to the same publisher, transcribe it in association with the publisher to which it corresponds.

><CITE>New York : Ivison, Phinney, and Co. ; London : Trübner & Co.</CITE>

<a name="4.201.8.4">4.201.8.4</a> Do not, however, transcribe a subsequent place as a place of publication if it must be recorded as a grammatically inseparable part of another element.

>Example:

<a name="4.201.8.5">4.201.8.5</a> If a place of publication associated with an earlier manifestation appears together with the actual place of publication of the manifestation being described, transcribe the places as a single element in the order in which they appear.

>Example:  
><CITE>Philadelphia printed, London reprinted</CITE>

<a name="4.201.8.6">4.201.8.6</a> If both the place of publication and [Name of publisher](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-publisher/) associated with an earlier manifestation appear together with the place of publication and [Name of publisher](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-publisher/) of the manifestation being described, transcribe each place with the [Name of publisher](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-publisher/) to which it corresponds.

>Example:  
><CITE>London : Printed for Knight and Lacy, Paternoster-Row ; Greenfield, Mass. : Re-printed by Ansel Phelps, and for sale by him at his bookstore, also by West & Richardson, Cummings, Hilliard & Co., Boston, and Wilder & Campbell, New-York</CITE>

<a name="4.201.95.1">4.201.95.1</a> If the place of publication appears only as a grammatically inseparable part of another area and is transcribed there, or appears only as a grammatically inseparable part of the statement of publication and is transcribed there, supply the place of publication in square brackets. Use a modern English form of the name, if there is one.

>Example:  
><CITE>[Munich] : Durch Peter Clement, Kunstführer zu München</CITE>

## 4.201.96 Fictitious or incorrect places of publication

<a name="4.201.96.1">4.201.96.1</a> If the place of publication appearing on the manifestation is known to be fictitious or incorrect, transcribe it nonetheless and make an explanatory [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/).
