## 4.01 Sources of information

<a name="4.01.1">4.01.1</a> The sources of information for the all production, publication, distribution and manufacture elements are the title page, colophon, other preliminaries, and dust jacket (see [Integrity of the copy](/DCRMR/introduction/#ix-integrity-of-the-copy)), in that order of preference. Consider the wording, layout, and typography of the manifestation itself when determining the most appropriate place to transcribe information relating to production,  publication, distribution and manufacture. If the information for an element is not present in these sources, any source may be used to supply needed information (see [Transcription](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/)). If statements belonging to different elements are found in separate sources, combine them to make a complete statements.  However, do not combine statements belonging to a single element when they appear in different sources within the manifestation.

<a name="4.01.2">4.01.2</a> If any part of the production, publication, distribution, or manufacture elements are taken from a source other than the title page, make a note to indicate the source (see [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/), [4.206.3.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#4.206.3.1); [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/), [4.216.3.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#4.216.3.1); and [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/), [4.226.3.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#4.226.3.1)).

<a name="4.01.3">4.01.3</a> Make a note about information not transcribed in the statement if considered important (see [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement), [4.206.3.2](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#4.206.3.2); [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/), [4.216.3.2](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#4.216.3.2); [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/), [4.226.3.2](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#4.226.3.2)).

## 4.02 Form and order of information

<a name="4.02.1">4.02.1</a> Transcribe the manufacture elements in the form and order in which it is presented in the source, unless instructed otherwise by specific rules.

<a name="4.02.2">4.02.2</a> If statements belonging to different elements appear out of order, or as part of another area, and they are grammatically separable, transpose them as needed. Make a note indicating the original position of the transposed elements (see [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/), [4.206.3.3](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#4.206.3.3); [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/), [4.216.3.3](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#4.216.3.3); [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/), [4.226.3.3](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#4.226.3.3)). 

<a name="4.02.3">4.02.3</a> If the elements are not grammatically separable, or their transposition would result in an ambiguous or otherwise confusing construction, transcribe them in the order found and supply missing elements in square brackets as needed (see [Transcription](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/)).
