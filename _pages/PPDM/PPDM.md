## 5.01.1 Sources of information

<a name="5.01.1.1">5.01.1.1</a> The sources of information for the all production, publication, distribution and manufacture elements are the title page, colophon, other preliminaries, and dust jacket (see [Integrity of the copy](/DCRMR/introduction/#ix-integrity-of-the-copy)), in that order of preference. Consider the wording, layout, and typography of the manifestation itself when determining the most appropriate place to transcribe information relating to production,  publication, distribution and manufacture. If the information for an element is not present in these sources, any source may be used to supply needed information (see [Transcription](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/)). If statements belonging to different elements are found in separate sources, combine them to make a complete statements.  However, do not combine statements belonging to a single element when they appear in different sources within the manifestation.

<a name="5.01.1.2">5.01.1.2</a> If any part of the production, publication, distribution, or manufacture elements are taken from a source other than the preferred source of information, make a note to indicate the source (see [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/), [5.24.31.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#5.24.31.1); [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/), [5.285.31.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.31.1); and [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/), [5.34.31.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.31.1)).

<a name="5.01.1.3">5.01.1.3</a> Make a note about information not transcribed in the statement if considered important (see [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement), [5.24.31.2](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#5.24.31.2); [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/), [5.285.31.2](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.31.2); [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/), [5.34.31.2](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.31.2)).

<a name="5.01.1.4">5.01.1.4</a> Make a note on publication, distribution, manufacture, or copyright details that are not included in other elements if they are considered important (see [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement), [5.24.37.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#5.24.37.1); [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/), [5.285.37.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.37.1); [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/), [5.34.37.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.37.1); [Note on copyright date](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-copyright-date/), [4.232.3.3](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-copyright-date/#4.232.3.3)).

## 5.01.2 Element order

Note: only the elements related to publication are explicated below. The same order applies to elements related to distribution and manufacture.

<a name="5.01.2.1">5.01.2.1</a> General element order, punctuated according to ISBD:

>Place of publication : Name of publisher, Date of publication

<a name="5.01.2.2">5.01.2.2</a> Transcribe a parallel place of publication following the place of publication. Transcribe a parallel name of publisher following the name of publisher.

> Place of publication = Parallel place of publication : Name of publisher = Parallel name of publisher, Date of publication

## 5.01.3 Form and order of information

<a name="5.01.3.1">5.01.3.1</a> Transcribe production, publication, distribution, or manufacture elements as they appear on the preferred source of information, unless instructed otherwise by specific rules, as instructed in [Transcription](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/).

<a name="5.01.3.2">5.01.3.2</a> If statements belonging to different elements appear out of order, or as part of another area, and they are grammatically separable, transpose them as needed. Make a note indicating the original position of the transposed elements (see [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/), [5.24.31.3](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#5.24.31.3); [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/), [5.285.31.3](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.31.3); [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/), [5.34.31.3](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.31.3)). 

>Example:  
>Distribution statement: <CITE>Huddersfield [England] : Printed and sold by Brook and Lancashire <CITE>

>Example:  
>Distribution statement: <CITE>London : Sold also by Vernor and Hood, Crosby and Letterman</CITE>
>Note on Distribution Statement: <CITE>Place of distribution, "London," is printed below distributorâ€™s name on title page.</CITE>

<a name="5.01.3.3">5.01.3.3</a> If the elements are not grammatically separable, or their transposition would result in an ambiguous or otherwise confusing construction, transcribe them in the order found and supply missing elements in square brackets as needed (see [Transcription](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/)).

>Example:  
>Distribution statement: <CITE> London: printed and published by C. Lowndes, No. 66, Drury-Lane; and sold by H.D. Symonds, Paternoster Row, 1800</CITE>

>Example:
>Distribution statement: <CITE>[Bristol] : sold by Lasbury, Bristol</CITE>
