## 4.21B Definition and scope

<a name="4.21B.1">4.21B.1</a> A name of manufacturer in another language or script.

## 4.21C Statements in more than one language or script

<a name="4.18C.1">4.21C.1</a> Take parallel manufacturers’ names from the same source as the manufacturer’s name. Make a note on parallel manufacturers’ names found elsewhere if considered important for identification. See Note on manufacture statement(https://ladylazarus3.github.io/Test2/docs/PPDM/Note-on-manufacture-statement/).

<a name="4.18C.2">4.21C.2</a> Make a note to indicate the original position on the source of any transposed statements. See Note on manufacture statement.(https://ladylazarus3.github.io/Test2/docs/PPDM/Note-on-manufacture-statement/). 

<a name="4.18C.3">4.21C.3</a> **Optional omission:** If it is considered that the names are too numerous to record exhaustively and some may be omitted without significant loss of identification then all parallel manufacturers’ names after the third may be omitted. Supply in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission. Include the number of omitted names  in the supplied phrase.
