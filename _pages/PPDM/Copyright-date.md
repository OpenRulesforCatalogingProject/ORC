## 4.23.3 Copyright dates and dates of deposit 

<a name="4.23.3.1">4.23.3.1</a> Transcribe a copyright date or a date of deposit as part of the copyright date element.

<a name="4.23.3.2">4.23.3.2</a> If a [Date of publication](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-publication/), [Date of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-publication/), etc., does not appear on the manifestation and it is likely that the date of copyright or deposit represents the [Date of publication](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-publication/), supply the date in square brackets as the [Date of publication](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-publication/). Include a question mark if the supplied date is conjectural and record the copyright date in the copyright date element. Make a note to indicate that the basis for the supplied date is the date of copyright or deposit. Include in the [Note on copyright date](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-copyright-date/) as much information as is deemed important to the cataloging agency (see [4.232.3.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-copyright-date/#4.232.3.1)).

Provide an explanation for the supplied date in a [Note on copyright date](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-copyright-date/) (see [4.232.3.2](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-copyright-date/#4.232.3.2)).

<a name="4.23.3.4">4.23.3.4</a> If the publication bears both a [Date of publication](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-publication/), [Date of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-publication/), etc., and a date of copyright or deposit, the latter information may be recorded in the copyright date element if considered important.
