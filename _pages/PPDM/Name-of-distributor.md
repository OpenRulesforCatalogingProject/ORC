Supply the [place of distribution](/DCRM/docs/ppdm/Place-of-distribution/)or [date of distribution](/DCRM/docs/ppdm/Date-of-distribution/), in square brackets in the appropriate element.

## 4.203.5 Distributor statements containing only addresses, signs, or initials

<a name="4.203-5.1">4.203-5.1</a>  If only the address, sign, or initials of the distributor, appears in lieu of the name, transcribe the statement containing the address, sign, or initials as the [name of distributor](/DCRM/docs/ppdm/Name-of-distributor/). If the distributor’s name can be identified, supply it in square brackets after the initials or before or after the address or sign, as appropriate, or give the information in a note. See [note on distribution statement](/DCRM/docs/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement).

<a name="4.203-5.2">4.203-5.2</a>  If the identification of the distributor is based on a device, supply the name of the distributor in square brackets, even if the device includes the distributor’s initials or spelled-out name. Make a note as necessary about the basis for the identification, the source of the information used, the presence of the device, etc. See [note on distribution statement](/DCRM/docs/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement).

## 4.203.6 Fictitious or incorrect distributor statements

<a name="4.203-6.1">4.203-6.1</a> If the [distributor statement](/DCRM/docs/ppdm/Distributor-statement) is known to be fictitious or incorrect, transcribe it nonetheless and make an explanatory note.

<a name="4.203-7.1">4.203-7.1</a> If the [distributor statement](/DCRM/docs/ppdm/Distributor-statement) includes more than one distributor, in a single source, transcribe all the names in the order in which they appear.

<a name="4.203-7.2">4.203-7.2</a> *Optionally*, if it is considered that the names are too numerous to list exhaustively, and that some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, the [distributor statement](/DCRM/docs/ppdm/Distributor-statement) may be shortened by omitting all the names after the third. In such cases, use the mark of omission and supply after it in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission. Include the number of omitted publishers (or firms) in the supplied phrase.

```sold by Sherwood & Co. ... ; Hurst ... ; Forrest, … Manchester [and 3 others in 1 other place]```

## 4.203.9 Supplied and conjectured names of distributors

<a name="4.203-9.1">4.203-9.1</a> If no name, address, or device of a distributor appears on the manifestation, supply the name of the distributor in square brackets if known. If the responsibility of a distributor for a particular manifestation is conjectured, either add a question mark to any supplied name or give the information in a note.

<a name="4.203-95.1">4.203-95.1</a> If the name of the distributor does not appear in the [distributor statement](/DCRM/docs/ppdm/Distributor-statement/), but has already been transcribed as part of another element, supply it in a short identifiable form within square brackets.

## 4.203.96 Distributor name in more than one language or script
