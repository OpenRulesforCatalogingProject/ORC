<a name="5.27.1.2">5.27.1.2</a> [Sources of information](/DCRMR/ppdm/#5011-sources-of-information)

## 5.27.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="5.27.2.1">5.27.2.1</a> A nomen that is a name of an agent who is responsible for distributing a published manifestation.

## 5.27.3 General rule

<a name="5.27.3.1">5.27.3.1</a> Transcribe the names of distributors as part of this element.

<a name="5.27.3.2">5.27.3.2</a> Transcribe the name of the distributor, together with any associated words or phrases, as it appears on the manifestation. In general, transcribe the full address. Consider the sequence, layout, and typography of words in the distribution statement when determining the most appropriate element in which to transcribe the address. If address information is grammatically inseparable from the distributor’s name, transcribe that information as part of name of distributor.

>Example:  
><CITE>sold for the editor, by Messrs. Dulau & Co.</CITE>

>Example:  
><CITE>No. 107, Wardour-Street; De Boffe, No. 7, Gerrard-Street, Soho; and T. Boosey, Broad-Street, behind the Royal Exchange</CITE>

>Example:  
><CITE>sold at wholesale by Horace Partridge, importer, wholesale and retail dealer in fancy goods, toys, watches, jewelry, Yankee notions, beads, &c. No. 27 Hanover Street Boston</CITE>

>Example:  
><CITE>Sold by William Berry, at the Sign of the Globe between Charing-cross and Whitehall</CITE>

<a name="5.27.3.3">5.27.3.3</a> *Optionally*, omit addresses and insignificant information appearing with the distributor's name, unless the information aids in identifying or dating the manifestation or is deemed important to the cataloging agency (e.g., for the purpose of capturing book trade data). If omitting addresses, use the mark of omission.

>Example:  
><CITE>sold for the editor, by Messrs. Dulau & Co. ... De Boffe ... and T. Boosey ...</CITE>

## 5.27.31 Names of distributors containing grammatically inseparable place names or dates

<a name="5.27.31.1">5.27.31.1</a> If the [Distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Distribution-statement/) contains grammatically inseparable statements relating to [Place of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-distribution/) or [Date of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-distribution/), transcribe the information as part of the name of distributor element. Supply the [Place of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-distribution/) or [Date of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-distribution/) in square brackets in the appropriate element.

>Example:  
><CITE>[Greenfield, Massachusetts] : printed and sold at Greenfield, Massachusetts</CITE>

## 5.27.32 Names of distributors containing only addresses, signs, or initials

<a name="5.27.32.1">5.27.32.1</a> If only the address, sign, or initials of the distributor appears in lieu of the name, transcribe the statement containing the address, sign, or initials as the name of distributor. If the distributor’s name can be identified, supply it in square brackets after the initials or before or after the address or sign, as appropriate, or give the information in a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) (see [5.285.34.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.34.1)).

>Example:  
><CITE>to be sold at the signe of the Blacke Beare [by Edward Blount] in Pauls Church-yard</CITE>

<a name="5.27.32.2">5.27.32.2</a>  If the identification of the distributor is based on a device, supply the name of the distributor in square brackets, even if the device includes the distributor’s initials or spelled-out name. Make a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) as necessary about the basis for the identification, the source of the information used, the presence of the device, etc. (see [5.285.34.2](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.34.2)).

## 5.27.33 Fictitious or incorrect names of distributor

<a name="5.27.33.1">5.27.33.1</a> If the name of distributor is known to be fictitious or incorrect, transcribe it nonetheless and make an explanatory note. If the actual details are known, or can be reasonably surmised, supply the correction and its basis in a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) (see [5.285.34.3](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.34.3)).

<a name="5.27.33.2">5.27.33.2</a> *Optionally*, if the name as transcribed is known to be fictitious, transcribe it as it appears and supply in square brackets the actual name, preceded by “that is,” if known. Give the basis for the correction or clarification in a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) (see [5.285.34.4](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.34.4)).

## 5.27.34 Two or more names of distributors

<a name="5.27.34.1">5.27.34.1</a> If the [Distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Distribution-statement/) includes more than one distributor in a single source, transcribe all the names in the order indicated by the sequence, layout, or typography of the names on the source of information. Transcribe them as subsequent statements of distribution only when they are not linked by connecting words or phrases.

<a name="5.27.34.2">5.27.34.2</a> *Optionally*, if it is considered that the names are too numerous to list exhaustively, and that some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, the [Distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Distribution-statement/) may be shortened by omitting all the names after the third. In such cases, use the mark of omission and supply after it in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission. Include the number of omitted distributors in the supplied phrase.

>Example:  
><CITE>sold by Sherwood & Co. ... ; Hurst ... ; Forrest, … Manchester [and 3 others in 1 other place]</CITE>

<a name="5.27.34.3">5.27.34.3</a> If both the [Place of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-distribution/) and name of distributor associated with an earlier edition appear together with the [Place of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-distribution/) and name of distributor of the edition being described, transcribe each distributor with the place to which it corresponds.

>Example:  
><CITE>Printed for T. Cooper, at the Globe in Pater-noster-Row, 1742, and reprinted for J. Wilkie, St. Paul's Church-yard</CITE>
> 
<a name="5.27.34.4">5.27.34.4</a> If both the [Place of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-distribution/) and name of distributor associated with an earlier edition appear together with the [Place of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-distribution/) and name of distributor of the edition being described, transcribe each distributor with the place to which it corresponds.

## 5.27.35 Names of distributors in multipart monographs

<a name="5.27.35.1">5.27.35.1</a> If the manifestation is issued in more than one physical part and the name of distributor or the distributor’s form of name changes in the course of publication, transcribe the [Distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Distribution-statement/) of the first or earliest part and always give the [Distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Distribution-statement/) of the later part(s) in a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) (see [5.285.34.5](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.34.5)).

## 5.27.36 Supplied and conjectured names of distributors

<a name="5.27.36.1">5.27.36.1</a> If no name, address, or device of a distributor appears on the manifestation, supply the name of the distributor in square brackets if known and if considered important. If the responsibility of a distributor for a particular manifestation is conjectured, either add a question mark to any supplied name or give the information in a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/). In any case of a supplied distributor give supporting evidence in a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) (see [5.285.34.6](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.34.6)).

## 5.27.37 Name of distributor cannot be supplied

<a name="5.27.37.1">5.27.37.1</a> If no distributor’s name can be conjectured, record  “distributor not identified” in square brackets if considered important.

## 5.27.38 Name of distributor transcribed as part of another element

<a name="5.27.38.1">5.27.38.1</a> If the name of the distributor does not appear in the [Distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Distribution-statement/), but has already been transcribed as part of another element, supply it within square brackets.

If transcribing a distributor name as part of another element, do not abridge or expand the name of distributor simply because it repeats or omits information given elsewhere in the description.

## 5.27.39 Name of distributor in more than one language or script

<a name="5.27.39.1">5.27.39.1</a> If the name of the distributor appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the statement in the language or script of the [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/), or if this criterion does not apply, transcribe the statement that appears first. Transcribe the remaining statement(s) as parallel statements (see [Parallel name of distributor](/DCRMR/ppdm/Parallel-name-of-distributor/)). Always make a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) to indicate the original position on the source of any transposed statements (see [5.285.34.7](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.34.7)).
