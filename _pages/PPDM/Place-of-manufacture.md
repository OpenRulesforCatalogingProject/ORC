<a name="4.221.3.2">4.221.3.2</a> Transcribe the place of manufacture as it appears on the manifestation. If the place appears together with the name of a larger jurisdiction (e.g., country, state, or similar designation), or multiple such jurisdictions, transcribe these as well.

## 4.221.5 Supplied modern forms of place names

<a name="4.221.5.1">4.221.5.1</a> If considered necessary for identification and if known, supply in square brackets the modern form of the name of the place. Use an English form of the name, if there is one.

## 4.221.6 Supplied fuller forms of place names 

<a name="4.221.6.1">4.221.6.1</a>  If a place name is found only in an abbreviated form on the manifestation, transcribe it as found. Supply in square brackets the full form of the name, or the remainder of the name, if considered necessary for identification.

## 4.221.7 Supplied larger jurisdictions

<a name="4.221.7.1">4.221.7.1</a> Supply in square brackets the name of the country, state, province, etc., after the name of the place if it is considered necessary for identification, or if it is considered necessary to distinguish the place from others of the same name. Use a modern English form of the name, if there is one. Use the abbreviations listed in [RDA Toolkit: Resources: Abbreviations and symbols](https://beta.rdatoolkit.org/en-US_ala-aacfb802-7f30-3bcd-8311-3f8b52c0c42c){:target="_blank"}. 

## 4.221.8 Two or more places of manufacture

<a name="4.221.8.1">4.221.8.1</a> If the manifestation shows two or more places of manufacture, and all are related to the same manufacturer, transcribe all in the order in which they appear.

<a name="4.221.8.2">4.221.8.2</a> *Optionally*, if it is considered that the places are too numerous to list exhaustively, and that some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, the place of manufacture may be shortened by omitting all the places after the third. In such cases, use the mark of omission and supply after it in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission. Include the number of omitted places (if more than one) in the supplied phrase.

<a name="4.221.8.3">4.221.8.3</a> If a subsequent place of manufacture is not related to the same manufacturer, transcribe it in association with the manufacture to which it corresponds.

<a name="4.221.8.4">4.221.8.4</a> Do not, however, transcribe a subsequent place as a place of manufacture if it must be recorded as a grammatically inseparable part of another element.

<a name="4.221.8.5">4.221.8.5</a> If a place of manufacturer associated with an earlier manifestation appears together with the actual place of manufacture of the manifestation being described, transcribe the places as a single element in the order in which they appear.

<a name="4.221.8.6">4.221.8.6</a> If both the place and [Name of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/) associated with an earlier manifestation appear together with the place and [Name of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/) of the manifestation being described, transcribe each place with the manufacturer to which it corresponds.

## 4.221.9 Places of manufacture in multipart monographs

<a name="4.221.9.1">4.221.9.1</a> If the manifestation is issued in more than one physical part, and the place of manufacture changes in the course of publication, give the place of manufacture of the later part(s) in a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/) (see [5.34.32.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.32.1)).

## 4.221.95 Place names that are grammatically inseparable parts of other elements 

<a name="4.221.95.1">4.221.95.1</a> If the place of manufacture appears only as a grammatically inseparable part of another element and is transcribed there, supply the place of manufacture in square brackets (see [4.22.7.3](/DCRMR/ppdm/Manufacture-statement/#4.22.7.3)). Use a modern English form of the name, if there is one.

## 4.221.96 Fictitious or incorrect places of manufacture

<a name="4.221.96.1">4.221.96.1</a> If the place of manufacture appearing on the manifestation is known to be fictitious or incorrect, transcribe it nonetheless and make an explanatory [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/). If the actual place is known, or can be reasonably surmised, supply a correction in square brackets. Use a modern English form of name, if there is one, and give the basis for the correction in a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/) (see [5.34.32.2](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.32.2)).

<a name="4.221.96.2">4.221.96.2</a> *Optionally*, if the place name is known to be fictitious, transcribe it as it appears and supply in square brackets the actual place name, if known. Give the basis for the correction or clarification in a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/) (see [5.34.32.3](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.32.3)).

Use a modern English form of the name, if there is one, and include the name of the larger jurisdiction if considered necessary for identification. Use the location associated with the first transcribed manufacturer if one is present. Provide a justification for the supplied place in a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/) if necessary (see [5.34.32.4](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.32.4)).

<a name="4.221.97.2">4.221.97.2</a> If the name of the place of manufacture has changed over time, supply the name appropriate to the [Date of manufacture](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-manufacture/) if known (e.g., Leningrad, not Saint Petersburg, for manifestations published in that city between 1924 and 1991). If considered necessary for identification, also supply the modern place name and the name of the larger jurisdiction.

## 4.221.98 Place of manufacture supplied based on address or sign

<a name="4.221.98.1">4.221.98.1</a> Supply in square brackets the name of the place of manufacture using a modern English form of the name, if there is one, when only an address or description of a trade sign appears on the manifestation. (Transcribe the address or sign as the [Name of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/) element; see [4.223.5.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/#4.223.5.1).) When supplying the place, give a justification in a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/) if necessary (see [5.34.32.4](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.32.4)).

<a name="4.221.99.2">4.221.99.2</a> If no city of manufacture can be conjectured, supply the name of a state, province, country, or other larger geographic entity as the place of manufacture with a question mark if necessary, using a modern English form of the name, if there is one, all in square brackets.

<a name="4.221.99.3">4.221.99.3</a> If the reason for supplying the place is not apparent from the rest of the description, make a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/) to indicate the source of the information (see [5.34.32.5](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.32.5)). 

<a name="4.221.99.4">4.221.99.4</a> If no place of manufacture can be conjectured, record “Place of manufacture not identified” in square brackets.

## 4.221.995 Place names in more than one language or script

<a name="4.221.995.1">4.221.995.1</a>  If the name of the place of manufacture appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the statement in the language or script of the title proper, or if this criterion does not apply, transcribe the statement that appears first. Transcribe the remaining statement(s) as [Parallel statements of manufacture](/DCRMR/ppdm/Parallel-place-of-manufacture/). Make a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement) to indicate the original position on the source of any transposed statements (see [5.34.35.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.35.1)).
