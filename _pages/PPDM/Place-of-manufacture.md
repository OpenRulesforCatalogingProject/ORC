<a name="5.31.3.2">5.31.3.2</a> Transcribe the place of manufacture as it appears on the manifestation. If the place appears together with the name of a larger jurisdiction (e.g., country, state, or similar designation), or multiple such jurisdictions, transcribe these as well.

## 5.31.31 Place of manufacture with initial prepositions, etc.

<a name="5.31.31.1">5.31.31.1</a> Include in the transcription any prepositions appearing before the place of manufacture as well as any accompanying words or phrases associated with the place name.

>Example:  
><CITE>In Venetia</CITE>

## 5.31.32 Supplied modern forms of place names

<a name="5.31.32.1">5.31.32.1</a> If considered necessary for identification and if known, supply in square brackets the modern form of the name of the place. Use a modern form of the name in the language of the cataloging agency.

## 5.31.323 Supplied fuller forms of place names 

<a name="5.31.323.1">5.31.323.1</a>  If a place name is found only in an abbreviated form on the manifestation, transcribe it as found. Supply in square brackets the full form of the name, or the remainder of the name, if considered necessary for identification.

## 5.31.325 Supplied larger jurisdictions

<a name="5.31.325.1">5.31.325.1</a> Supply in square brackets the name of the country, state, province, etc., after the name of the place if it is considered necessary for identification, or if it is considered necessary to distinguish the place from others of the same name. Use a modern form of the name in the language of the cataloging agency. 

<a name="5.31.325.2">5.31.325.2</a> *Optionally*, use the abbreviations for names in English listed in [RDA Toolkit: Abbreviations of terms in English for countries and states](https://beta.rdatoolkit.org/Resource/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-d2830026-0cec-3123-ab3c-9214bdada254){:target="_blank"}. 

## 5.31.33 Two or more places of manufacture

<a name="5.31.33.1">5.31.33.1</a> If the manifestation shows two or more places of manufacture, and all are related to the same manufacturer, transcribe all in the order in which they appear.

<a name="5.31.33.2">5.31.33.2</a> *Optionally*, if it is considered that the places are too numerous to list exhaustively, and that some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, the place of manufacture may be shortened by omitting all the places after the third. In such cases, after the third place, supply in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission. Include the number of omitted places (if more than one) in the supplied phrase. Do not use a mark of omission.

<a name="5.31.33.3">5.31.33.3</a> If a subsequent place of manufacture is not related to the same manufacturer, transcribe it in association with the manufacture to which it corresponds.

<a name="5.31.33.4">5.31.33.4</a> Do not, however, transcribe a subsequent place as a place of manufacture if it must be recorded as a grammatically inseparable part of another element.

<a name="5.31.33.5">5.31.33.5</a> If a place of manufacture associated with an earlier manifestation appears together with the actual place of manufacture of the manifestation being described, transcribe the places as a single element in the order in which they appear.

<a name="5.31.33.6">5.31.33.6</a> If both the place and [Name of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/) associated with an earlier manifestation appear together with the place and [Name of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/) of the manifestation being described, transcribe each place with the manufacturer to which it corresponds.

## 5.31.34 Places of manufacture in multipart monographs

<a name="5.31.34.1">5.31.34.1</a> If the manifestation is issued in more than one physical part, and the place of manufacture changes in the course of publication, always give the place of manufacture of the later part(s) in a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/) (see [5.34.32.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.32.1)).

## 5.31.35 Place names that are grammatically inseparable parts of other elements 

<a name="5.31.35.1">5.31.35.1</a> If the place of manufacture appears only as a grammatically inseparable part of another element and is transcribed there, supply the place of manufacture in square brackets (see [5.29.34.3](/DCRMR/ppdm/Manufacture-statement/#5.29.34.3)). Use a modern form of the name in the language of the cataloging agency.

## 5.31.36 Fictitious or incorrect places of manufacture

<a name="5.31.36.1">5.31.36.1</a> If the place of manufacture appearing on the manifestation is known to be fictitious or incorrect, transcribe it nonetheless and make an explanatory [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/). If the actual place is known, or can be reasonably surmised, supply the correction and give its basis in a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/) (see [5.34.32.2](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.32.2)).

<a name="5.31.36.2">5.31.36.2</a> *Optionally*, if the place name is known to be fictitious, transcribe it as it appears and supply in square brackets the actual place name, preceded by "that is," if known. Use a modern form of the name in the language of the cataloging agency, and give the basis for the correction or clarification in a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/) (see [5.34.32.3](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.32.3)).

>Example:  
>Place of manufacture: <CITE>Cosmopoli [that is, London]</CITE>  
>Note on manufacture statement: <CITE>The imprint is fictitious; printed in London by Richard Field (cf. STC)</CITE>  
>(*Comment*: The formal citation for STC  is given in a References to published descriptions note)

## 5.31.37 No place of manufacture

<a name="5.31.37.1">5.31.37.1</a> If no place of manufacture appears on the manifestation but is known and is considered important, supply it in square brackets. Use a modern form of the name in the language of the cataloging agency, and include the name of the larger jurisdiction if considered necessary for identification. Use the location associated with the first transcribed manufacturer if one is present. Provide a justification for the supplied place in a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/) if necessary (see [5.34.32.4](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.32.4)).

<a name="5.31.37.2">5.31.37.2</a> If the name of the place of manufacture has changed over time, supply the place name appropriate to the [Date of manufacture](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-manufacture/) if known (e.g., Leningrad, not Saint Petersburg, for manifestations published in that city between 1924 and 1991). If considered necessary for identification, also supply the modern place name and the name of the larger jurisdiction, preceded by "that is," in the language of the cataloging agency.

## 5.31.38 Place of manufacture supplied based on address or sign

<a name="5.31.38.1">5.31.38.1</a> Supply in square brackets a modern form the name in the language of the cataloging agency, when only an address or description of a trade sign appears on the manifestation. (Transcribe the address or sign as the [Name of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/); see [5.32.32.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/#5.32.32.1).) When supplying the place of manufacture, give a justification in a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/) if necessary (see [5.34.32.5](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.32.5)).

## 5.31.385 Place of manufacture uncertain or unknown

<a name="5.31.385.1">5.31.385.1</a> If the place of manufacture is uncertain and is considered important, supply the name of the probable place of manufacture with a question mark, using a modern form of the name in the language of the cataloging agency in square brackets.

<a name="5.31.385.2">5.31.385.2</a> If no city of manufacture can be conjectured, supply the name of a state, province, country, or other larger geographic entity as the place of manufacture with a question mark if necessary, using a modern form of the name in the language of the cataloging agency in square brackets.

<a name="5.31.385.3">5.31.385.3</a> If the reason for supplying the place is not apparent from the rest of the description, always make a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/) to indicate the source of the information (see [5.34.32.6](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.32.6)). 

<a name="5.31.385.4">5.31.385.4</a> If no place of manufacture can be conjectured, record “Place of manufacture not identified” in square brackets.

## 5.31.39 Place names in more than one language or script

<a name="5.31.39.1">5.31.39.1</a>  If the place of manufacture appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the place in the language or script of the [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/) or, if this criterion does not apply, transcribe the place that appears first. Transcribe the remaining place(s) as [Parallel place of manufacture](/DCRMR/ppdm/Parallel-place-of-manufacture/). Always make a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement) to indicate the original position on the source of any transposed statements (see [5.34.33.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.33.1)).
