## 5.325.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="5.325.2.1">5.325.2.1</a> A nomen that is a name of manufacturer in another language or script.

## 5.325.31 Manufacturer names in more than one language or script

<a name="5.325.31.1">5.325.31.1</a> Take parallel manufacturers’ names from the same source as the [Name of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/). Make a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement) on parallel manufacturers’ names found elsewhere if considered important (see [Note on manufacture statement, 5.34.35.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.35.1)).

<a name="5.325.31.2">5.325.31.2</a> Make a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement) to indicate the original position on the source of any transposed statements (see [5.34.34.7](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.34.7)). 

<a name="5.325.31.X">5.325.31.X</a> If the [Name of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/) appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the place in the language or script of the [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper) as a [Name of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/) element. If this criterion does not apply, transcribe the [Name of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/) that appears first.

<a name="5.325.31.X">5.325.31.X</a> Transcribe remaining [Names of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/) as parallel names of manufacturer. If a parallel name of manufacturer is from a different source than the [Name of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/), make a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement) if considered important (see [Note on manufacture, 5.34.35.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.35.1)).

<a name="5.325.31.3">5.325.31.3</a> *Optionally*,  if the parallel names of manufacturer are too numerous to list exhaustively and some may be omitted without significant loss of identification then all parallel manufacturers’ names after the third may be omitted. In such cases, after the third parallel name of distributor, supply in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission. Include the number of omitted names (if more than one) in the supplied phrase. Do not use a mark of omission.
