DCRMR is not yet approved for cataloging. At this time, please do not create bibliographic records with the DCRMR descriptive convention source code. When DCRMR is approved, updates will be posted under “Current status” in the [preface](/DCRMR/preface/) and on the [RBMS Bibliographic Standards Committee DCRM and RDA page](https://rbms.info/dcrm/rda/){:target="_blank"}, and will be announced via DCRM-L and other appropriate venues.

## A1. Introduction

In MARC 21 bibliographic records, a code may be used in field 040 subfield $e to indicate when specific cataloging conventions have been followed *in addition to* the conventions identified in the descriptive cataloging form (Leader/18). This appendix offers guidance in using “dcrmr,” the description convention source code designating DCRMR, in 040 subfield $e.

DCRMR is intended to be used with the current version of the RDA Toolkit (previously known as the Beta Toolkit). Code field 040 with **$e rda $e dcrmr**, in this order, directly following the language of cataloging (**040 $b**), (e.g., **$b eng $e rda $e dcrmr**). Code LDR/18 (Descriptive cataloging form) **i** (ISBD punctuation) or **c** (ISBD punctuation omitted) in accordance with the cataloger’s institutional practices (see [PCC Guidelines for Minimally Punctuated Records](https://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/documents/PCC-Guidelines-Minimally-Punctuated-MARC-Data.docx){:target="_blank"} for further guidance).
