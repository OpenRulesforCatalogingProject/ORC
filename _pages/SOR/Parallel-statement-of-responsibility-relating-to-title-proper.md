## 2.21.3 Statements of responsibility following titles in more than one language or script 

<a name="2.21.3.1">2.21.3.1</a> If there are titles in more than one language or script, but only a single statement of responsibility, transcribe the statement of responsibility after all the title information.

<a name="2.21.3.2">2.21.3.2</a> If there are both titles and statements of responsibility in more than one language or script, transcribe each statement of responsibility after the title proper, parallel title, or other title information to which it relates.
