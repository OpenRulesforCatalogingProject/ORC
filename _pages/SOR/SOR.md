## 2.01.1 Sources of information

<a name="2.01.1.1">2.01.1.1</a> The source of information for the statement of responsibility is the title page(s) ([Data provenance, 0.1.5](/DCRMR/general-rules/Data-provenance/#015-sources-of-information). The preferred source of information for multipart monographs is the title page of the first volume. The preferred source of information for single-sheet manifestations is the whole sheet, including both sides (see [Data provenance, 0.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Data-provenance/)).

## 2.01.2 Element order

<a name="2.01.2.1">2.01.2.1</a> Element order for statement of responsibility elements is integrated with the instructions for title elements (see [Title, 1.01.2](/DCRMR/title/#1012-element-order)).
