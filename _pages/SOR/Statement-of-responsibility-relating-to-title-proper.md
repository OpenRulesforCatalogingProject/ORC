<a name="2.21.38.2">2.21.38.2</a> If a statement with grammatically inseparable elements contains information relating both to the publication, distribution, or manufacture of the resource and to the agents who have contributed to its intellectual or artistic content, use judgment in deciding whether to transcribe the statement as part of the [Publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Publication-statement/), [Distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Distribution-statement/), or [Manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Manufacture-statement/) or as a statement of responsibility relating to title proper (see [5.2.34.4](/DCRMR/ppdm/Publication-statement/#5.2.34.4), [5.25.34.4](/DCRMR/ppdm/Distribution-statement/#5.25.34.4), [5.29.34.4](/DCRMR/ppdm/Manufacture-statement/#5.29.34.4)).
