<a name="2.20.94.2">2.20.94.2</a> If a noun or noun phrase occurring in conjunction with a statement of responsibility is indicative of the role of the person(s) or body (bodies) named in the statement of responsibility rather than of the nature of the work, treat it as part of the statement of responsibility.

<a name="2.20.94.3">2.20.94.3</a> In case of doubt, treat the noun or noun phrase as part of the statement of responsibility.

<a name="2.20.96.2">2.20.96.2</a> If a statement with grammatically inseparable elements contains information relating both to the publication, distribution, or manufacture of the resource and to the agents who have contributed to its intellectual or artistic content, use judgment in deciding whether to transcribe the statement as part of the [Publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Publication-statement/), [Distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Distribution-statement/), or [Manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Manufacture-statement/) or as a statement of responsibility (see [4.20.8.4](/DCRMR/ppdm/Publication-statement/#4.20.8.4), [4.21.7.4](/DCRMR/ppdm/Distribution-statement/#4.21.7.4) [4.22.7.4](/DCRMR/ppdm/Manufacture-statement/#4.22.7.4)).
