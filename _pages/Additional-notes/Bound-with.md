## 9.45.3 General rule

<a name="9.45.3.1">9.45.3.1</a> Record this relationship as a structured note, beginning with the words “bound with” followed by a colon. List the related items, in the order in which they are found. List all related items in the description for the first item and, in general, only the first item in the descriptions for the subsequent items. 

<a name="9.45.3.2">9.45.3.2</a> For each item listed, give only the elements listed below:

1. The [RDA Toolkit: Creator agent of work](https://beta.rdatoolkit.org/Content/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-6277a869-961d-379f-8ae8-7ec159052a26){:target="_blank"}; normally give this element first, usually in access point form (e.g., with inversion of personal names under surname, but not necessarily including personal birth/death dates, corporate qualifiers, etc.)

2. The [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/) as found in the description for the manifestation; long titles may be shortened (whenever the preferred title of work is considered useful for the identification of the work, record it within square brackets preceding the title of manifestation)

3. The primary [Statement of responsibility relating to title proper](/DCRMR/sor/Statement-of-responsibility-relating-to-title-proper/) as recorded in the description for the manifestation, unless it is redundant of the [RDA Toolkit: Creator agent of work](https://beta.rdatoolkit.org/Content/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-6277a869-961d-379f-8ae8-7ec159052a26){:target="_blank"} or exceedingly lengthy
