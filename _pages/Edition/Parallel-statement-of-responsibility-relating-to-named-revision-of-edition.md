## x3.255.3 General rule

<a name="x3.255.3.1">x3.255.3.1</a> If there are [Designations of named revision of edition](/DCRMR/edition/Designation-of-named-revision-of-edition/) in more than one language or script on the manifestation, but only a single statement of responsibility relating to named revision of edition, transcribe the statement of responsibility as the [Statement of responsibility relating to named revision of edition](/DCRMR/edition/Statement-of-responsibility-relating-to-named-revision-of-edition/) (see [x3.25.31.1](/DCRMR/edition/Statement-of-responsibility-relating-to-named-revision-of-edition/#x3.25.31.1)).

<a name="x3.255.3.2">x3.255.3.2</a> If a statement of responsibility relating to named revision of edition appears on the manifestation in more than one language or script, record the statement in the language or script of the title proper as [Statement of responsibility relating to named revision of edition](/DCRMR/edition/Statement-of-responsibility-relating-to-named-revision-of-edition/). If this criterion does not apply, record the statement that appears first. 

<a name="x3.255.3.3">x3.255.3.3</a> Transcribe the remaining statement(s) as parallel statements of responsibility relating to named revision of edition.
