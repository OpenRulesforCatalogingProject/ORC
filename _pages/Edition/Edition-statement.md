## 3.21.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="3.21.2.1">3.21.2.1</a> A statement that identifies an edition to which a manifestation belongs.

<a name="33.21.2.2">3.21.2.2</a> An edition statement sometimes includes a designation of a named revision of an edition. An edition statement sometimes includes a statement of responsibility relating to the edition or to a named revision of an edition.

## 3.21.3 General rule

<a name="3.21.3.1">3.21.3.1</a> Transcribe a statement relating to an edition or issue of a manifestation as it
appears, according to the general guidelines (see [General rules](/DCRMR/general-rules/)). Include any explanatory words or phrases appearing with the edition statement.

<a name="3.21.3.2">3.21.3.2</a> Make a [Note on edition statement](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/) if the edition statement is transposed from its position on the source of information (see [3.26.31.2](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/#3.26.31.2)).

## 3.21.31 No edition statement 

<a name="3.21.31.1">3.21.31.1</a> If the manifestation does not contain an edition statement, but is known to contain significant changes from other editions, or an edition statement for it is provided by a reference source, do not supply an edition statement based on this information. Give the information in a [Note on edition statement](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/) (see [3.26.32.1](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/#3.26.32.1)).

<a name="3.21.31.2">3.21.31.2</a> If the manifestation contains only a statement that refers to another edition (e.g., as part of a preface to an earlier edition or a summary of the work’s publication history), do not transcribe the information as an edition statement and do not supply an edition statement based on the information. A [Note on edition statement](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/) may be made on such statements if considered important (see [3.26.32.2](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/#3.26.32.2)).

## 3.21.32 Edition statements that are grammatically inseparable parts of other transcribed elements

<a name="3.21.32.1">3.21.32.1</a> If an edition statement is a grammatically inseparable part of the [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/), [Other title information](/DCRMR/title/Other-title-information/), [Statement of responsibility relating to title proper](/DCRMR/sor/Statement-of-responsibility-relating-to-title-proper/), or any other transcribed element, then transcribe as part of the element to which it is integrated or linked and do not repeat it as an edition statement. 

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>Blunt's edition of the Nautical almanac and astronomical ephemeris for the year 1815</CITE>

>Example:  
>Title proper: <CITE>Old New York, or, Reminiscences of the past sixty years </CITE>  
>Other title information: <CITE> being an enlarged and revised edition of the anniversary discourse delivered before the New York Historical Society … </CITE>

<a name="3.21.33.1">3.21.33.1</a> If information pertaining to other elements of the description (e.g., an original title or other information concerning the original work) is grammatically inseparable from the [Designation of edition](/DCRMR/edition/Designation-of-edition) according to one or more of the conditions enumerated in [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/), transcribe it as part of the [Designation of edition](/DCRMR/edition/Designation-of-edition) (see [1.21.31.1](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/#1.21.31.1)). If illustration statements or statements such as “in two volumes” appear with a [Designation of edition](/DCRMR/edition/Designation-of-edition), transcribe them as they appear (see also [1.23.35.1](/DCRMR/title/Other-title-information/#1.23.35.1)).

>Example:  
> <CITE>A new edition in two volumes</CITE>

## 3.21.34 Two or more works on the preferred source of information with at least one edition statement

<a name="3.21.34.1">3.21.34.1</a> If the preferred source of information bears the titles of two or more individual works contained in the manifestation, and one or more of these works has an edition statement associated with it, transcribe each edition statement that is grammatically linked to another element (e.g., [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/), [Statement of responsibility relating to title proper](/DCRMR/sor/Statement-of-responsibility-relating-to-title-proper/), or any other transcribed element) within that element. Transcribe edition statements not grammatically linked to another element as individual statements. Indicate the work to which each edition statement corresponds in a [Note on edition statement](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/) (see [3.26.33.1](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/#3.26.33.1)).

## 3.21.35 Edition statements relating to issues or parts

<a name="3.21.35.1">3.21.35.1</a> If the manifestation consists of multiple issues or parts, including accompanying material, and there are edition statements relating to the whole as well as to parts, transcribe only the edition statements relating to the whole manifestation.

<a name="3.21.35.2">3.21.35.2</a> Make a [Note on edition statement](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/) relating to issues or parts if considered important (see [3.26.34.1](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/#3.26.34.1)).

## 3.21.36 Nonce collections

<a name="3.21.36.1">3.21.36.1</a> If cataloging a nonce collection (a volume made up of previously published pamphlets, usually reissued with a collective title page), and one or more parts have edition statements, make a [Note on edition statement](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/) giving edition statements relating to the parts (see [3.26.35.1](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/#3.26.35.1)).

<a name="3.21.36.2">3.21.36.2</a> If edition statements of parts vary between exemplars of a manifestation, make a [Note on edition statement](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/) describing the situation and record the edition statements of the item in hand relating to individual parts in a [Note on item](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-item) (see [9.4.32.1](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-item/#9.4.32.1)).

## 3.21.37 Edition statements on multipart monographs

<a name="3.21.37.1">3.21.37.1</a> For a multipart monograph, if the edition statement varies or does not appear on all of the volumes, ascertain whether the set was issued as such, using the following guidelines:

a) If other exemplars of the set are known to have the same combination of editions, assume the set was issued as such.  
b) If there is no other exemplar of the set known with the same combination of editions, and other exemplars with different combinations of editions are known, assume the set in hand was not issued as such.  
c) If there are no other known exemplars of the set, assume the set was issued as such.

In case of doubt, assume the set was not issued as such.

If the manifestation was issued as such, transcribe all edition statements. Indicate the edition statements corresponding to individual volumes through encoded data and/or a [Note on edition statement](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/) (see [3.26.36.1](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/#3.26.36.1)). 

>Example:  
>Edition statement: <CITE>v. 1: The second edition</CITE>  
>Edition statement: <CITE>v. 2: The first edition</CITE>  
>Note on edition statement: <CITE>Vol. 1 issued as the second edition and vol. 2 issued as the first edition</CITE>

<a name="3.21.37.2">3.21.37.2</a> Make a [Note on edition statement](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/) indicating the absence of edition statements if considered important (see [3.26.36.1](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/#3.26.36.1)).

>Example:      
>Edition statement: <CITE>The second edition</CITE>  
>Note on edition statement: <CITE>Volumes 2-3 issued without the edition statement</CITE>

<a name="3.21.37.3">3.21.37.3</a> If the multipart monograph is known or assumed to be a made-up set describe the monograph using one of the following methods:

a) Make separate descriptions for each edition. In each description, indicate that the set is imperfect, identifying missing volumes in the [Note on extent of item](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-extent-of-item/) (see [9.43.3.2](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-extent-of-item/#9.43.3.2)).

>Example:      
>Edition statement: <CITE>Second edition</CITE>  
>Note on extent of item: <CITE>Library's copy imperfect: v. 2 wanting; a previous owner has supplied v. 2 from the 3rd ed. to create a made-up set</CITE>  
>(*Comment*: The first of two descriptions associated with the made-up set)

>Example:       
>Edition statement: <CITE>Third edition</CITE>  
>Note on extent of item: <CITE>Library's copy imperfect; v. 1 wanting; a previous owner has supplied v. 1 from the 2nd ed. to create a made-up set</CITE>  
>(*Comment*: The second of two descriptions associated with the made-up set)

b) Describe the set, basing the description on the first or preponderant edition. Indicate in a [Note on manifestation](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-manifestation/) that the description is based on a made-up set (see [9.3.33.1](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-manifestation/#9.3.33.1)).

>Example:      
>Edition statement: <CITE> First edition</CITE>  
>Note on manifestation: <CITE>Description based on a made-up set; v. 3 has "second edition"</CITE>
